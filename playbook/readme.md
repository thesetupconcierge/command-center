# 📘 The Setup Concierge Playbook

> How this machine works — and how to build one yourself.

This playbook documents the operational system behind Setup Concierge. Each page is standalone, ELI5-friendly, and designed to be read in under 2 minutes.

## Rules

- **One screen per page.** If you're scrolling, it's too long.
- **ELI5 first, details later.** Lead with the analogy, follow with the how.
- **Auto-staleness.** `/consolidate` flags pages that haven't been updated in 7 days.
- **Hardening V8.8.9.** System hardened on 2026-02-17 (Telemetry, CSS, Surgical Triggers).
