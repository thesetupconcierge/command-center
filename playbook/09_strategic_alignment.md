# 09 — Strategic Alignment

> **Purpose:** Ensure every operational system serves the 5-Year Directional Framework. This chapter bridges the *why* (strategy) with the *how* (daily operations).
>
> **Source:** Advisory Panel — Systems Alignment Review, February 28, 2026

## Core Directive

> **Strategic North Star:** *"I understand systems deeply enough to operate calmly inside complexity."*

**Current Phase:** A (Depth-Building)  
**Primary Lever:** Increase Technical Depth  
**Phase Start:** February 28, 2026

Every system, workflow, and document should be evaluated through this lens:

> *Does this serve Phase A? Does it increase depth, maintain stability, or prepare for future phases — without fragmenting focus?*

## System-to-Phase Role Map

Every operational component has a defined role per phase. When building, modifying, or evaluating any system — check this table.

| System | Phase A Role | Phase B Role | Phase C Role |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Dashboard** | Depth tracking + financial floor + OKR visibility | Add federal pipeline tracker | Client management + revenue scaling |
| **Playbook** | Operational hygiene + strategic alignment | Add federal compliance chapter | Add LLC operations chapter |
| **Workflows** | Depth-building support + phase reminders | Add `/federal-prep` workflow | Add `/client-onboard-gov` |
| **Registry** | Knowledge base + panel archives | Add cleared docs section | Add client-facing docs |
| **Advisory Panel** | Strategic governance + depth accountability | Federal transition advisory | LLC operations advisory |
| **V8 Engine** | Depth-building tool — architectural discipline | Portfolio anchor — proof of mastery | Potential product vehicle |
| **Black Nexus** | SC case study + V8 showcase | Federal exposure vehicle | Independent entity |
| **Captain's Log** | Depth insights + system observations | Network tracking | Client engagement log |

## Phase Discipline Rules

### Phase A (Current) — What to DO

- Build depth through institutional literacy work
- Track progress via Systems Literacy Baseline (quarterly)
- Log insights in the Proof of Depth Archive
- Maintain financial stability (floor > expenses)
- Build V8 as a depth-building tool

### Phase A — What to AVOID

- Premature monetization (no consulting sales, no brand launch)
- Ego-driven federal pivots (don't chase clearance for status)
- Comparison-driven decisions (don't react to peers' income)
- Lane-jumping (stay in depth-building, don't fragment)
- Building features for "Phase C" before Phase A is complete

### Phase Conversion Triggers

Phase advancement is by **signal**, not calendar:

- **A → B:** Someone senior asks you to explain a system to their team
- **B → C:** A federal recruiter contacts you inbound
- **C activation:** You receive a referral for advisory work without having a website

## Workflow Phase Annotations

Every workflow should be evaluated for Phase A relevance:

| Workflow | Phase A Relevance | Notes |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| `/morning` | **HIGH** | Includes Strategic Phase Reminder |
| `/consolidate` | **HIGH** | Includes Step 8.5 Strategic Alignment Gate |
| `/strategic-review` | **HIGH** | Quarterly framework evaluation |
| `/panel-review` | **HIGH** | Strategic governance |
| `/sprint-check` | **HIGH** | Sprint accountability |
| `/coherence` | **HIGH** | System integrity |
| `/deploy-dashboard` | **MED** | Infrastructure maintenance |
| `/snapshot` | **MED** | Data protection |
| `/cleanup` | **MED** | Operational hygiene |
| `/hygiene` | **MED** | Naming standards |
| `/search` | **MED** | Knowledge access |
| `/founder-briefing` | **MED** | Strategic input processing |
| `/vance-briefing` | **MED** | High-leverage audit |
| `/build-site` | **LOW** | Phase A: only for active clients (WNQ) |
| `/new-client` | **LOW** | Phase A: capacity limited to 1 client |
| `/new-session` | **LOW** | Phase A: existing clients only |
| `/new-opportunity` | **LOW** | Phase A: career stability, not churn |
| `/registry-purge` | **LOW** | Archive maintenance |
| `/recovery` | **LOW** | Emergency only |

> **Rule:** LOW-relevance workflows during Phase A should trigger a pause: "Is this serving depth, or distraction?"
