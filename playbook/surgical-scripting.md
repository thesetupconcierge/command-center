# Surgical Scripting — Coding for the CDA

This track is designed to bridge the gap between "Operations" and "Engineering" within the **Clinical Development Agency (CDA)** ecosystem. We don't just learn to code; we learn to build clinical-grade automation.

## 🎙️ The Philosophy: "Surgical Tools, Not Toys"

Most coding tutorials teach you how to build a Todo list. In the CDA, we teach you how to:

- **Parse the Hub**: Manipulate JSON state to automate dashboard renders.
- **Protocol Automation**: Write scripts that trigger based on Gist sync events.
- **Surgical Strings**: Use Regex to extract intelligence from the Captain's Log.

## 🕹️ Interactive Lab: "The V8 Console"

*Integration coming to Career Hub.*

### Level 1: The Pulse Check

```javascript
// TASK: Check if the WNQ Revenue goal is on track.
const revenue = 1500; 
const goal = 3000;
const status = revenue >= goal ? "MISSION COMPLETE" : "STAY SURGICAL";
console.log(status);
```

### Level 2: The Gist Weaver

Learning how to fetch and update states via the GitHub Gist API — the backbone of our "Surgical Sync."

## 📚 CDA-Relevant Tracks

1. **Vanila JS (The Blade)**: No frameworks. Pure logic for high-performance dashboarding.
2. **Bash/Shell (The Forcep)**: Mastering the CLI for project structural integrity.
3. **Markdown Engineering**: Using structured MD to feed the AI-driven pipeline.
