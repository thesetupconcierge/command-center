# Black Nexus — Collaboration Charter v1.0

This charter defines the governance and operational rules for the partnership between **Justice McKinney** (Founder) and **JB Scott** (Implementation Partner) within the Black Nexus Clinical Development Agency (CDA).

## 🏛️ 1. Governance & Authority

- **Justice McKinney:** Chief Vision Officer. Holds final approval on all branding, strategy, and strategic pivots.
- **JB Scott:** Technical Implementation Lead. Owns the delivery lifecycle of tactical roadmap items under the SC Playbook standards.
- **The Advisory Panel:** Serves as the independent auditor and mediator for operational health. Includes the **Sprint Command** (Tactical) and the **General Advisory Panel** (Strategic).
- **Team Evolution:** As JB's workflow volume and capacity increase, he is encouraged to design and activate his own dedicated **Sprint Command** unit under the supervision of the Founder's panel.
- **Liability & Indemnity:** Each party agrees to indemnify the other against any claims arising from their respective acts or omissions. J4AFoundation LLC is not liable for technical delivery failures, security breaches, or data loss in Black Nexus client projects.
- **Termination & Ownership:** In the event of partnership dissolution, all existing client contracts and the "Black Nexus" brand IP remain the property of Justice McKinney (Founder). This includes clients explicitly labeled as **"Agency Leads."** JB Scott retains ownership of leads he personally referred (**"Partner Referrals"**) and his independent developer tooling not derived from the V8 Engine.
- **Autonomy Gate (Phase 2):** JB Scott is encouraged to design his own dedicated **Sprint Command** unit once he has achieved the **Autonomy Threshold**: 3 consecutive successful client deliveries with 100% adherence to the **Clinical OS** standard. Until this threshold is met, all tactical delivery remains under the direct supervision of the Founder's **Sprint Command**.

## ⚖️ 2. Intellectual Property (The V8 Rule)

- All core engine technologies (V8 Engine, Studio Flow, AI Agents) are provided as service capabilities and remain the exclusive property of J4AFoundation LLC.
- New assets created specifically for Black Nexus clients are owned by the client (upon payment) or Black Nexus LLC.
- **Repository Safety:** No proprietary core logic should be moved to personal repositories.

## 🧭 3. Communication & Workflow

- **Dashboard-First:** If it's not on the Command Center, it doesn't exist.
- **Surgical Updates:** Use logbook-style commits and daily Captain's Log entries to maintain 10-second findability.
- **Agent Intermediary:** Both partners are expected to use **Antigravity** as the primary context manager to minimize back-and-forth sync meetings.

## 📊 4. The Revenue Milestone

- **First-Dollar Win:** The primary focus of Phase 1 is achieving the first paid client delivery.
- **Success Fees:** Participation in revenue splits is tied strictly to the successful delivery of items in the [BN Roadmap](debriefs/bn_roadmap_2026-02-13.md).

## 🛰️ 5. Strategic Implementation Gateways

- **Expert Audit:** The General Advisory Panel serves as the independent quality gate for all major delivery milestones.
- **Strategic Directives:** The Founder reserves the right to issue **Binding Strategic Directives (BSD)** based on private Advisory counsel. These directives take precedence over existing tactical items in the roadmap.
- **Operational Masking:** Partners will receive clinical requirements generated from strategic consultations but will not have access to the internal deliberations of the Advisory Panel.

*By pulling the shared repository, both partners acknowledge and agree to the operational standards set forth in this charter.*
