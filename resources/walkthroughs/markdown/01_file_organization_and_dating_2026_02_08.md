# File Organization & Dating — Walkthrough

**Date:** February 8, 2026

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Session Assets Restructured

Reorganized `WNQ/Sessions/2026-02-07 Photo Session/` — moved all files into `Assets/Markdown/` and `Assets/PDF/` subfolders.

### 2. Website & Strategy Assets Restructured

Applied the same `Assets/Markdown/` + `Assets/PDF/` pattern to `WNQ/Website & Strategy/`.

### 3. Dates Added to All Files

- **Website & Strategy** — 8 files renamed with `_2026-02-06` suffix
- **Black Nexus Pitch Decks** — 4 files renamed with `_2026-02-06`
- **Black Nexus Strategy** — 6 files renamed with `_2026-02-06`
- **Black Nexus Tasks** — 2 files renamed with `_2026-02-06`
- **Sessions** — already had dates, no changes needed

### 4. WNQ/Assets Renamed to Media

Renamed `WNQ/Assets/` → `WNQ/Media/` per user request.
