# Daily Summary — February 13, 2026

## 🎯 Primary Accomplishment

Successfully pivoted the ecosystem from a general "Creative Agency" to a specialized **Clinical Development Agency (CDA)**. Established a robust governance framework, conducted a full 10-member strategic audit, and tightly specialized the operational workflows for the **Black Nexus Strategic Roadmap**.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

- **Brand Pivot (CDA)**: Surgically rebranded all 10+ core documents to "Clinical Development Agency".
- **Collaboration Relinking**: Switched `command-center` to the shared `blacknexuscda` organization.
- **BN Roadmap & Onboarding**: Created a focused task list and onboarding guide for partner JB Scott.
- **Governance Charter v1.0**: Established mutual indemnification and Founder IP protection.
- **Full Panel Audit (All 10)**: Conducted a multi-dimensional strategic review (SC Private).
- **Workflow Optimization**: Encoded "Push One, Push All" and "SC-Private Masking" into system protocols.
- **Manager Sync**: Aligned Derek and Darius on the new "Clinical Rigor" standards.

## 📌 Action Items Added

- [ ] JB to build the Black Nexus Command Center (Dashboard Mirroring).
- [ ] Monitor shared repo for 10-second rule compliance (Darius).
- [ ] Filter General Advisory strategic input for JB (Derek).
- [ ] Execute Illinois LLC formation (Target: ASAP).

## 🔑 Key Decisions

- **Digital Diagnostics**: The agency now leads with diagnostics and implementation rigor.
- **SC Only vs. Shared**: Strategy/Admin is private; implementation/ops is shared.
- **Surgical Sync**: All repos committed and pushed as one unit to prevent version drift.

## 📂 Git Checkpoint

- `command-center`: Synced refurbished CDA docs, charter, and roadmap.
- `Business Ideas`: Logged manager sync and panel audit.
- `antigravity`: Refined workflows for SC-Private protocols.
