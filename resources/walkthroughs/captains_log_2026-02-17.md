## 💎 Value Essence Extraction

- **Technical Breakthrough**: Executed System-Wide Hygiene Reset (829 file renames) without breaking link integrity.
- **Architecture**: Registry Hub evolved into a "Surgical Vault" with high-priority filtering logic.
- **Revenue**: Revenue Goal Alignment Bar implemented in Finance Hub ($5,000 "Freedom Level" target).
- **UI/UX**: Hardened mobile table responsiveness and implemented Contextual Sidebar logic.

## 📖 Story Vault Candidates

- *Narrative Theme*: The "Clinical Standard" as a forcing function for ecosystem scaling and operational discipline.
