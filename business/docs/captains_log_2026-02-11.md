> Mary called back, twice since last update, the first call she just relayed to me that the abbvie team thought the interview went well and would be figuring out next steps afterwards. The second call she told me that they were asking about availability and willingness for overtime and off hour shifting, so as to accommodate the scientists schedules.

> Mary called twice, first time was to inform me that the Abbvie team thought the interview went well and would talk to her soon about any further steps. She also mentioned what a great thank you letter that was and says it may have been one of the best she's ever seen! Also, second call, she called and told me that they were asking how open I am to extra hours, and off hours scheduling due to the scientists schedule who we share the space with, they say it may potentially happen frequently but there's no pressure to always oblige. I told Mary I am used to 12 hour data center shifts and this would not be a big deal due to that and also considering the only 35 minute commute to and from the campus. (This message is a rewrite of previous prep note at 1:50 PM)

> It would be nice to be able to view PDFs and the guides from this mobile view, across the entire system of course, otherwise this is great! Awesome way to be able to keep up some momentum and also not be tied to my laptop screen. And her 3 girlfriends lol

> Also, I'm noticing inability to exit error pages from many of the essentially 'dead links' — whatever pages or files we choose to not populate on mobile should be handled with grace.
