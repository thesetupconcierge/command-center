Ike,

First, I want to say I truly believe in what you're building with Warriors Never Quit.

After reviewing the current site and thinking through how we can position WNQ for stronger community engagement and easier donations, I've put together a structured proposal for a full digital revamp.

This is not just a redesign — it's a repositioning of your online presence to match the strength of your mission.

Attached is a detailed breakdown including:

- Scope of work
- Timeline (Feb 12 – Feb 27 launch)
- Investment structure
- Optional ongoing support

Because of our existing relationship and the recent photography session, I've applied a returning client credit toward the total investment.

Take a look and let me know when you'd like to review together. I can walk you through it live if helpful.

Excited about what this could become for WNQ.

— Justice
Setup Concierge
