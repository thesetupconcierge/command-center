Ike,

Great talking with you. Wanted to get this over while it's fresh.

Attached is the full scope — everything we talked about, laid out so you can share it with Terrence and Carley if you need to.

Quick recap:

- 6-page custom site built around Coach Riley's legacy and WNQ's mission
- Your photos from our session integrated throughout
- Mobile-first — looks great on every phone
- Live by end of February

The preview you saw is just the start. Once we lock in, I can have the full site built within two weeks.

Let me know how the board conversation goes — happy to jump on a call with them too if that helps.

— Justice
