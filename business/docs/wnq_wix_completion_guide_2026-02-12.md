### Section 2: The Man Behind the Name

```
Heading: The Man Behind the Name
```

```
Ike Riley Sr. — known to everyone simply as "Coach" — was raised in a single-parent home on the South Side of Chicago. Raised by his mother and grandmother alongside six siblings, he grew up in poverty without a male role model in his life.

As a young man, Ike didn't know anything about a God who loved him. He had no desire to attend church. He hustled and made money, never thinking about getting a traditional job. He completed high school but did not attend college.

But God had a plan for Coach.
```

### Section 3: Finding Faith (1996)

```
Heading: The Turning Point — Finding Faith
Subheading: 1996
```

```
God was already working on Ike Sr. before his mother passed. After her passing, Ike became withdrawn and quiet. His wife, Angela Riley, invited him to Liberty Temple Full Gospel Church in Chicago, under the leadership of Chief Apostle Dr. Clifford E. Turner.

A few months later, Ike Sr. accepted Jesus as Lord and Savior — 1996.

Within years, he was ordained as a Deacon, serving at Liberty Temple and helping lead the youth ministry titled "Boys to Men."

• 2012 — Ordained as an Elder at Liberty Temple
• 2013 — Joined Family Christian Center, reuniting in worship with his wife and family

### Section 4: The Coach — 23 Years (2002–2020)

```
Heading: The Coach
Subheading: 23 Years. Never Missed a Single Game.
```

```
Coach began leading the Liberty Warriors in 2002 at Liberty Temple Full Gospel Church. He coached and mentored until 2020, when he became ill.

23 years. Never missed a single game.

Coach entered the Liberty Warriors into tournaments and competitions through the Athletes For Christ Association (AFCA). The team's banner and prayer before every game: The Our Father Prayer — a prayer Angela taught Ike when they were just boyfriend and girlfriend.

The Warriors won many games, tournaments, and championships — so many that the church had to create new space for the trophies. Starting with basketball, Coach expanded to recruit young men for Warrior baseball teams as well.

### Section 5: Beyond the Court — A Life of Sacrifice

```
Heading: Beyond the Court
Subheading: A Life of Sacrifice
```

```
Coach never considered being a Deacon or a Coach a sacrifice. He served the church and the youth, thanking God every day for choosing him.

What Coach gave:
• Bought uniforms and equipment out of his own pocket
• Paid tournament fees and gym rentals himself
• Hosted barbecues for the team
• Gave young men small jobs so he could pay them instead of handing out money
• Hired team members at his own workplace when they needed jobs
• Attended graduations, trunk parties, birthdays, and family events for every player
• Got their school sports schedules and showed up to their games
• Took late-night phone calls from players and families in crisis
• Started his day at 4 AM during coaching seasons and ended as late as midnight driving teammates home
```

### Section 6: From Janitor to $4M Manager

**Pull Quote (gold, centered):**

```
"God blessed and prospered every good thing Coach put his hands to do."
```

```
After giving his life to Christ and becoming fully committed to God and the church, everything began to change.

Coach got a job at Sertoma, a nonprofit organization. He started as a janitor.

Then came promotion after promotion after promotion.

By the time his 37 years at Sertoma ended in 2020 due to illness, Coach Ike Riley Sr. was the Contract Janitorial Manager — having grown a department from $16,000/month to over $4,000,000+/month.
```

---

### Section 7: Continuing the Legacy

```
Heading: Continuing the Legacy
```

```
A man raised in poverty. No male role model. No knowledge of God. No college degree. No desire for church.

Yet through faith: 23 years of coaching. Hundreds of young men mentored. A janitor who built a $4M department. A father reconciled. A legacy that will never quit.
