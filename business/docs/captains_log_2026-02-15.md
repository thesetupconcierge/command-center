## 💎 Value Essence Extraction

### 🎯 Key Strategic Decisions

- **Capital Engine Framework**: Formally designated Sterling income as the baseline fuel for the BEAF ecosystem. All business revenue is now measured as "Growth Factor" relative to this $60/hr baseline.
- **ROI Parity**: Established that business revenue > 50% of career revenue is the primary scaling milestone.

### 🚀 Technical Breakthroughs

- **Financial Engine V1**: Implemented the Revenue Tracker on the dashboard sidebar with dynamic "Ecosystem Growth" bar and "Time-Shield" pulsing indicator.
- **Hub Hardening**: Resolved all global 404s for PDFs and implemented a collision-resistant deep link system for cross-hub navigation.
- **Investment Hub**: Scaffolding the Finances hub with a surgical Markdown-based ROI tracker for gear and API burn rates.

### 💸 Revenue Events

- **Sterling Confirmed**: $60/hr baseline ($10,400 monthly projected gross).
- **WNQ Monetization**: Phase 1A sprint initiated ($1,500 deposit pending).
