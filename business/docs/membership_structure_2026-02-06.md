# WNQ Membership Structure — Proposed Framework

## Overview

Two distinct membership paths designed to serve different roles in the WNQ community. Both tiers reinforce the brand pillars of **Integrity** and **Strength** while generating sustainable revenue for programs.

---

## 🏀 Tier 1: Warrior Membership (Youth / Players)

**For:** Kids and youth directly participating in WNQ sports programs, mentorship, and clinics.

| Feature | Included |
|---|---|
| Participation in all WNQ sports programs (basketball, baseball) | ✅ |
| Access to skills clinics and training camps | ✅ |
| WNQ team jersey or branded gear | ✅ |
| Mentorship pairing with a WNQ coach/volunteer | ✅ |
| Tournament and competition entry | ✅ |
| Academic check-ins and progress support | ✅ |
| Eligibility for Ike Riley Sr Memorial Scholarship | ✅ |
| Priority registration for WNQ events | ✅ |

**Suggested pricing:** $25–$50/season or sliding scale (no kid turned away)

**Positioning:** *"Every warrior gets in the game. Cost should never be a barrier."*
— Offer sponsored memberships funded by donors/partners for families who can't afford dues.

## 🤝 Tier 2: Legacy Membership (Parents / Supporters / Community)

**For:** Parents of enrolled youth, community supporters, alumni, and anyone who wants to back the mission.

| Feature | Included |
|---|---|
| Official WNQ Supporter status | ✅ |
| Quarterly newsletter with program updates and impact stories | ✅ |
| Invitation to exclusive WNQ events (Sneaker Ball Gala, etc.) | ✅ |
| Name recognition on WNQ website (Supporters section) | ✅ |
| WNQ branded merchandise (hat, pin, or shirt) | ✅ |
| Voting rights on community board decisions (optional) | ✅ |
| Early access to event tickets and fundraisers | ✅ |
| Tax-deductible contribution receipt | ✅ |

**Pricing:**

| Level | Cost | What You Get |
|---|---|---|
| **Community Member** | FREE | Newsletter, event invites, name on website, supporter status |
| **Sponsor a Warrior** | $50 (one-time or recurring) | All above + you directly fund a youth membership for a kid who can't afford one |

> Every $50 "Sponsor a Warrior" contribution covers one youth's season — gear, entry, mentorship, and scholarship eligibility. Sponsors are recognized on the website and at events.

**Positioning:** *"Join the team for free. Give $50 to put a kid in the game who otherwise couldn't play."*

---

## Revenue Model

| Source | Est. Annual |
|---|---|
| Warrior Memberships (50 youth × $35 avg) | $1,750 |
| Sponsor a Warrior contributions (30 sponsors × $50) | $1,500 |
| Event-driven signups and donations | Variable |
| **Total base membership revenue** | **$3,250+** |

*Free community memberships drive volume and engagement. Sponsor contributions directly fund youth slots. Scales with visibility, events, and corporate matching.*

## Implementation Notes

1. **Wix Members Area** already exists on the staging site — can be configured with membership tiers
2. **Payment:** Wix Pricing Plans app supports recurring membership billing
3. **Scholarship link:** Warrior Members automatically eligible — connects to the Ike Riley Sr Memorial Scholarship Program on the tribute page
4. **Onboarding:** Simple sign-up form with parent/guardian info for youth, email for supporters
5. **Engagement:** Monthly email or group post keeping members connected (leverage Wix Groups feature already on the site)

## Key Questions for Client

- [ ] Are there already membership fees being collected informally?
- [ ] Does the free + sponsor model work, or do they prefer tiered paid levels?
- [ ] Does the client want physical membership cards or digital-only?
- [ ] What's the desired launch timeline for memberships?
- [ ] Should sponsors be recognized publicly (website, events) or anonymously?
