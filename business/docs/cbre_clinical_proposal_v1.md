## 🔬 The "Clinical" Thesis

Rather than an engineer-for-hire model, Black Nexus proposes a **Diagnostic Operations Layer**. The Baxter facility in Round Lake is a critical environment where operational delay is a pathology. We implement the "Cure."

## 🎯 Primary Diagnostic Targets

1. **The 10-Second Facilities Rule**: Can a critical system failure (HVAC, Siemens Controls) be diagnosed, located, and assigned in under 10 seconds?
2. **Path Isolation**: Standardize the DMZ between maintenance logs and enterprise strategy to prevent context leaks.
3. **Clinical Hygiene**: A full audit of existing SOPs vs. real-world execution speed.

## 🏛️ The Diagnostic Alpha (Black Nexus Model)

Justice McKinney does not just "fix" a Siemens Desigo CC controller; he installs the **Clinical Implementation Protocol** so that:

- Every technician operates at a "Surgical Standard."
- Every log entry serves as a narrative asset for the Story Vault.
- Every system upgrade includes a **10% Innovation Wildcard** (automated diagnostics).

## 💰 Engagement Structure (Aiden & Evelyn)

- **Phase 1: Diagnostic Sweep (2 Weeks)** — $X,XXX Flat Fee.
- **Phase 2: Operational Stabilization (Retainer)** — $X,XXX/Month.
- **ROI**: 40% reduction in diagnostic search time and 100% documentation integrity.

## 🛰️ Activation Roster

- **👔 Derek Simmons (Ops Supervisor)**: Ensuring surgical alignment with Baxter standards.
- **🛡️ RayRay Navarro (QA/Lean-out)**: Compacting facilities documentation for instant retrieval.
- **🎨 Noa Chen (UX)**: Visualizing system heatmaps for the 10-second rule.
