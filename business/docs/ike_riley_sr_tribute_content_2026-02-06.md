## Page Vision

This page should feel like a **living museum / tribute** — not a standard bio. Think photo-rich, timeline-driven, emotionally powerful. Every section should honor Coach's legacy while inspiring visitors to carry it forward.

**Design direction:** Dark, reverent background with gold accents. Large photos. Timeline markers. Pull quotes between sections.

## Section 1: The Man Behind the Name

Ike Riley Sr. — known to everyone simply as **"Coach"** — was raised in a single-parent home on the South Side of Chicago. Raised by his mother and grandmother alongside six siblings, he grew up in poverty without a male role model in his life.

As a young man, Ike didn't know anything about a God who loved him. He had no desire to attend church. He hustled and made money, never thinking about getting a traditional job. He completed high school but did not attend college.

**But God had a plan for Coach.**

## Section 2: The Turning Point — Finding Faith (1996)

God was already working on Ike Sr. before his mother passed. After her passing, Ike became withdrawn and quiet. His wife, **Angela Riley**, invited him to **Liberty Temple Full Gospel Church** in Chicago, under the leadership of **Chief Apostle Dr. Clifford E. Turner**.

A few months later, Ike Sr. accepted Jesus as Lord and Savior — **1996**.

Within years, he was ordained as a **Deacon**, serving at Liberty Temple and helping lead the youth ministry titled **"Boys to Men."**

- **2012** — Ordained as an **Elder** at Liberty Temple
- **2013** — Joined **Family Christian Center**, reuniting in worship with his wife and family
- He continued coaching and mentoring with blessings from Leadership at Liberty Temple Full Gospel

## Section 3: The Coach — 23 Years, Never Missed a Game (2002–2020)

Coach began leading the **Liberty Warriors** in **2002** at Liberty Temple Full Gospel Church. He coached and mentored until **2020**, when he became ill.

**23 years. Never missed a single game.**

Coach entered the Liberty Warriors into tournaments and competitions through the **Athletes For Christ Association (AFCA)**. The team's banner and prayer before every game: **The Our Father Prayer** — a prayer Angela taught Ike when they were just boyfriend and girlfriend. He believed every child, church member or not, should know it.

The Warriors won **many games, tournaments, and championships** — so many that the church had to create new space for the trophies. Starting with basketball, Coach expanded to recruit young men for **Warrior baseball teams** as well.

## Section 4: Beyond the Court — A Life of Sacrifice

Coach never considered being a Deacon or a Coach a sacrifice. He served the church and the youth, thanking God every day for choosing him.

**What Coach gave:**

- Bought uniforms and equipment **out of his own pocket**
- Paid tournament fees and gym rentals himself
- Hosted **barbecues** for the team
- Gave young men **small jobs** so he could pay them instead of handing out money
- **Hired team members** at his own workplace when they needed jobs
- Attended **graduations, trunk parties, birthdays, and family events** for every player
- Got their **school sports schedules** and showed up to their games
- Took **late-night phone calls** from players and families in crisis
- Started his day at **4 AM** during coaching seasons and ended as late as **midnight** driving teammates home

His coaching went beyond courts and fields. The young boys and teens became young adults. Coach continued mentoring them through college and into adulthood — always a phone call away, always praying with them, always directing them to Jesus.

And through all of this, God graced Coach to still spend time with **his own boys** (now men) in their sports endeavors.

## Section 5: The Power of God — From Janitor to $4M Manager

After giving his life to Christ and becoming fully committed to God and the church, everything began to change.

Coach got a job at **Sertoma**, a nonprofit organization. He started as a **janitor**.

Then came promotion after promotion after promotion.

By the time his **37 years** at Sertoma ended in 2020 due to illness, Coach Ike Riley Sr. was the **Contract Janitorial Manager** — having grown a department from **$16,000/month** to over **$4,000,000+/month**.

*God blessed and prospered every good thing Coach put his hands to do.*

## Section 6: Reconciliation — A Father's Love Restored

Ike Sr. always wanted a relationship with his earthly father. During the **last twelve years** of his life, he finally had a genuine relationship with his biological father — a connection that filled Coach's heart with happiness.

He forgave his dad for all the years missed. He forgave the refusal to publicly acknowledge him as a son.

**God is Excellent.**

## Section 7: Continuing the Legacy

> *"What would be something very encouraging to know about Coach that would help others to know anything is possible when you put God first?"*

A man raised in poverty. No male role model. No knowledge of God. No college degree. No desire for church.

Yet through faith: **23 years of coaching. Hundreds of young men mentored. A janitor who built a $4M department. A father reconciled. A legacy that will never quit.**
