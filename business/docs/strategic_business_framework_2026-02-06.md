### Entity Status Summary

| Entity | State | Status | Purpose |
|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| **The One Eye Trust** | — | ✅ Active | Asset protection, legacy planning |
| **J4A Holdings LLC** | Wyoming | ✅ Active | Holding company (owns operating entities) |
| **J4A Foundation LLC** | Wyoming | ✅ Active | Operations layer (banking, contracts) |
| **Setup Concierge** | (DBA/Sub) | ✅ Active | Client services: web, photo, video |
| **Black Nexus LLC** | Illinois? | ⏳ Forming | Clinical development agency (CDA) (50/50 split) |
| **Five First Detailing** | Illinois | ❓ Verify | EIN exists — confirm if active or terminated |
| **Tavell Co** | Illinois | ❌ Terminated | Dissolved LLC |

### Key Insight: Where Black Nexus Fits

**Option A (Recommended):** Black Nexus forms as a **sibling to Setup Concierge** under J4A Foundation LLC. Your partner buys 50% of Black Nexus specifically (not the whole structure). This keeps your trust-protected hierarchy intact.

**Option B:** Black Nexus forms independently outside the trust structure, and you personally (or J4A Foundation) contracts with it. More separation, but less integration.

> **Discussion needed:** Which structure does your partner prefer? This affects liability, taxes, and your control.
