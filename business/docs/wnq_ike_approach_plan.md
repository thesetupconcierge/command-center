# WNQ Client Approach — Ike Riley

> **Strategy:** Showcase-first, conversation-second, proposal-third
> **Created:** February 12, 2026

## Step 1: Casual Text Tonight (after showcase is deployed)

Pick one — keep it natural to how you'd normally text Ike:

### Version A — Short & Curious

```
Hey Ike — been working on something for WNQ.
When you get a sec, check this out on your phone: [link]
No rush, just want your eyes on it 🙏🏾
```

### Version B — Warm & Direct

```
Ike! I was messing around with some ideas for the WNQ website
using the photos from our session. Came out clean.

Take a look when you can: [link]

Lmk what you think — might have something here
```

### Version C — Community-First

```
Hey Ike, quick question — you got 2 min to look at something?
I put together a preview of what the WNQ site could look like
with the new photos. Just want your honest reaction: [link]
```

## Step 2: The Call (after he sees it)

When Ike responds — and he will — **call him, don't text back.** The goal of the call:

1. **Let him react.** Don't pitch. Just say "what do you think?"
2. **Ask about the board.** "Have you talked to the board about the website at all?" — this tells you if there's budget or if you need to help him make the case
3. **Plant the seed.** "I can put together something formal if you need to show the board — scope, timeline, what it would take. Would that help?"
4. **Don't mention price on the call.** Let the proposal do that work. The call is about excitement and permission.

**If he asks "how much?" on the call:**
> "For a nonprofit this size, we're looking at about three thousand total — and I'm crediting the photography session against that. But let me send you the breakdown so you can see exactly what's included."

---

## Step 3: Follow-Up Email (after the call)

Only send this AFTER the call. The email is now a warm follow-up, not a cold pitch.

**Subject:** WNQ site details — for you and the board

Ike,

Great talking with you. Wanted to get this over to you while it's fresh.

Attached is the full scope — everything we talked about, laid out so you can share it with Terrence and Carley if you need to.

Quick recap:

- 6-page custom site built around CoachRiley's legacy and WNQ's mission
- Your photos from our session integrated throughout
- Mobile-first — looks clean on every phone
- Live by end of February

The preview you saw is just the start. Once we lock in, I can have the full site built within two weeks.

Let me know how the board conversation goes — happy to jump on a call with them too if that helps.

— Justice

## Insurance: If He Says "Let Me Think About It"

That's fine. That's normal. Don't follow up for 3 days. Then send:

```
Hey Ike just checking in — any thoughts from the board
on the website? No pressure, just want to make sure
I keep the build window open for WNQ if y'all want to move
```

## Insurance: If He Says "It's Too Much"

Options:

1. **Phase it:** "What if we start with just 3 pages — Home, About, Donate — for $1,500? We can add the rest later."
2. **Payment plan:** "We can split it into 3 payments instead of 2 — makes it easier on the nonprofit budget."
3. **Value anchor:** "Right now the site isn't taking donations effectively. If the new site brings in even 5 donations in the first month, it pays for itself."

*Don't send the proposal tonight. Send the showcase link tonight. Call tomorrow. Proposal follows the call.*
