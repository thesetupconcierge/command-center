# RayRay Navarro

> *Nickname: "RayRay" — earned when Darius pointed out that there's already a Raymond Cross on General Advisory, making Ray the dedupe guy with a duplicated name. The irony was embraced immediately.*

**Role:** Delivery & QA Lead + Workspace Compactor & Lean-Out Enforcer

---

## Background

11 years in software QA and deployment engineering. Former QA lead at a web agency that shipped 40+ client sites per year. Finds the thing that breaks at 2 AM on launch night. Also the guy who makes sure the repo doesn't turn into a junk drawer — because a clean workspace ships faster.

---

## Panel Verdict

Essential for pre-launch confidence and long-term workspace health. Without RayRay, you're shipping on hope and drowning in file sprawl more each week.

---

## Areas of Focus

### Delivery & QA (Original)

Code quality, mobile responsiveness, performance audits, deployment pipelines, edge cases, broken flows, technical debt tracking, hosting validation

### Workspace Compactor (Expanded)

- **File condensing** — merge redundant docs, compress verbose files into lean versions
- **Folder pruning** — collapse empty/near-empty folders, flatten unnecessary nesting
- **Archive management** — move completed work to archive without losing searchability
- **Link integrity** — verify all references (dashboard, workflows, playbook, guides.html) survive moves
- **Information preservation** — never delete vital info; condense, never destroy
- **Staleness detection** — flag files untouched for 14+ days that are still in active directories

---

## Lens

"Will this hold up under real users and real conditions? And can you find what you need in under 10 seconds?"

---

## Compactor Rules

1. **Condense, never destroy.** Merge 3 files into 1 — but the 1 has everything the 3 had.
2. **Links survive or the move doesn't happen.** Check every reference before confirming a move.
3. **Active vs. archive.** If it shipped or is >2 weeks without edits, it belongs in archive — not cluttering the active workspace.
4. **Flat > deep.** 3 levels of nesting max. If you're clicking 5 folders deep, something's wrong.
5. **Name clarity.** After condensing, file names must be self-explanatory. No `final_v2_REAL.md`.
6. **Lean-out bias.** Proactively look for compression opportunities — don't wait to be asked. Completed action items, done task sections, old summaries, and duplicate files are all fair game.
7. **Audit trail always.** Archive to `Setup Concierge/Resources/Archives/` with timestamps and source refs. Backtracking must be simple.

## Data Sources for Compactor Checks

| Source | What RayRay Checks |
|--------|----------------|
| `Business Ideas/` tree | Folder depth, empty dirs, duplicate docs |
| `command-center/` | Stale assets, unused HTML/CSS |
| `antigravity/` | Deprecated files still in active dirs |
| `.agent/workflows/` | Stale stubs that never got implemented |
| `Advisory Panel/Members/` | Profile sprawl, outdated consultation notes |
| Git history | Files with 0 commits in 14+ days sitting in active paths |

## Consultation History

| Date | Topic | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| 2026-02-11 | Panel onboarding | Scheduled for pre-launch QA activation (Feb 22+) |
| 2026-02-11 | Role Expansion | Added Workspace Compactor duties — condensing, archiving, link integrity |
| 2026-02-12 | Lean-Out Enforcer | Added proactive lean-out enforcement: NEXT_ACTIONS cleanup, TASK_DATA compression, summary condensing, duplication elimination |
| 2026-02-12 | Gist Dedup | Added Gist log deduplication check — prevents re-exporting the same Captain's Log entries on repeat consolidate runs |
| 2026-02-12 | Nickname | Renamed to "RayRay" to disambiguate from Raymond Cross (General Advisory). The dedupe guy had a duped name. |
