## Executive Summary

Following our meeting today, we've completed a full audit of the current warriorsneverquit.com website and the in-progress staging site. The staging site already fixes many issues from the original (broken nav, outdated content, missing CTAs), but several new pages and features were requested. This document outlines exactly what's been done, what's ready to build, and the phased plan to deliver a complete, polished website.
