## Panel Review Request

**To the Advisory Panel:** Please refine this proposal for maximum conversion and results. Specifically:

1. **Pricing** — Are the package tiers and price points positioned correctly for the Chicago nonprofit/small business market?
2. **Copy** — Does the messaging strike the right balance between professional and approachable?
3. **Packages** — Are the right deliverables included? Anything missing or unnecessary?
4. **Page structure** — Is the flow optimized for converting visitors to intake form submissions?
5. **Integration** — How should this new service pillar connect to the existing homepage without diluting the core message?
