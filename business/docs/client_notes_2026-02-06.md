# WNQ Client Meeting Notes — Feb 6, 2026

## Key Decisions from Client

- **Welcome & Home pages** → Merge into one combined landing page (same category)
- **Lion logo** is the official brand mascot — keep it front and center
- **Brand pillars:** Integrity & Strength

---

## Brand Identity Summary ⚠️ *PENDING UPDATES*

> Branding elements below are baseline from our initial audit. Final brand identity will be refined with client input on colors, typography, lion mascot usage, and pillar presentation. Updates in progress.

| Element | Current | Direction |
|---|---|---|
| **Mascot** | Lion (on site, inconsistently used) | Elevate — hero section, favicon, social avatars, all print |
| **Pillars** | Not explicitly stated on site | **Integrity, Strength** — need visual treatment (icon strip, banner) |
| **Tagline** | "Empowering Lives Daily" | Keep — strong and clear |
| **Subtitle** | "Faith in Action. Hope in Motion." | Keep — reinforces mission |
| **Colors** | Royal Blue `#0047AB`, Gold `#FFB81C`, B&W | Good palette — needs consistent application + possible refresh |
| **Typography** | Default Wix fonts, inconsistent sizing | Needs unified font system — bold sans-serif headings |
| **Voice** | Faith-driven, community-first | Add "Coach" references, pillar language throughout |
| **Nickname** | "Coach" (Ike Riley Sr.) | Weave into all legacy and brand content |

## Current Website Audit (warriorsneverquit.com)

### Navigation — Needs Cleanup

The nav has **13 links**, many pointing to the same URL. This confuses visitors.

| Page              | URL                        | Status              |
|-------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| Home              | `/`                        | ✅ Keep (merge w/ Welcome) |
| Welcome           | `/`                        | 🔄 Merge into Home         |
| Blog Feed         | `/`                        | ❌ Points to homepage      |
| Ike Riley Sr Life | `/ike-riley-sr-life`       | ✅ Keep — Legacy page      |
| Service List      | `/`                        | ❌ Points to homepage      |
| Event Details     | `/`                        | ❌ Points to homepage      |
| Projects          | `/`                        | ❌ Points to homepage      |
| Instagram         | `/`                        | ❌ Should link to IG       |

| Book Online       | `/book-online`             | ✅ Keep                    |
| Donate            | `/donate`                  | ✅ Keep — critical CTA     |
| Groups            | `/groups`                  | ⚠️ Evaluate need           |
| Members           | `/members`                 | ⚠️ Evaluate need           |
| Blog              | `/blog`                    | ✅ Keep if active          |

### Content Strengths

- **Legacy section** (Ike Riley Sr.) is powerful — 23 years coaching, "Our Father Prayer" ritual, deep personal stories
- **Mission statement** is clear and heartfelt
- **Team section** names board members
- **Services** (Fundraising, Clothing/Food, Sports Outreach) are well-defined

### Content Weaknesses

- "ASSITANCE" is misspelled (should be "Assistance") — appears in nav + section headings
- "Service List" section says "FOLLOW YOUR HEART" on Sports Outreach — doesn't match WNQ branding
- 4th board member slot is blank/unnamed
- Social links use raw URLs as section headers (sloppy)
- Instagram link points to homepage, not actual IG
- TikTok/IG shown as raw URLs rather than clean social icons
- Copyright says © 2024 — should be © 2026
- No clear impact numbers or stats

## Revamp Opportunities

### 🔥 High Priority

1. **Merge Home & Welcome** — single powerful landing page ✅ (client confirmed)
2. **Clean up navigation** — remove broken/duplicate links, reduce to 5-6 core pages
3. **Fix the lion mascot placement** — hero section, favicon, social avatars
4. **Brand pillars on display** — Add "Integrity" and "Strength" as visible pillars (icon strips or banner)
5. **Fix typos** — "ASSITANCE" → "Assistance", update copyright year

### 🎯 Medium Priority

1. **Social media links** — Replace raw URLs with proper icon buttons linking to real profiles
2. **Impact stats section** — "23 years coaching", "X youth mentored", "X events hosted"
3. **Board member #4** — Fill or remove the empty slot
4. **Consistent CTA colors** — Gold buttons (`#FFB81C`) on blue/black backgrounds everywhere
5. **Blog strategy** — Either activate with regular posts or remove from nav

### 💡 Growth Opportunities

1. **Testimonials/Stories** — Former youth athletes sharing how WNQ changed their lives
2. **Photo gallery** — Dedicated page for events (March Madness, Kingdom Hoops, etc.)
3. **Newsletter signup** — Currently buried in footer; make it a prominent section
4. **Sponsor showcase** — Logos/names of supporters to build credibility
5. **Programs page** — Dedicated page with details on each initiative (Sports, Mentorship, Care Kits, Veterans)
6. **Video content** — Highlight reels, testimonials, event recaps (leverage TikTok content)
7. **Online store** — WNQ branded merchandise (jerseys, hats) as fundraising channel

## Client Call — Round 2 Updates

### "Coach" = Ike Riley Sr

- **"Coach"** is Ike Riley Sr.'s nickname — use it throughout the site alongside his full name
- Referred to as "Coach", "Ike Sr.", "Coach Riley" interchangeably by the community

### Tribute Page Vision: Museum Feel

- The Ike Riley Sr. tribute page should feel like a **tribute / museum experience** — not just a bio page
- Pull more photos from the existing `/ike-riley-sr-life` page on the original site
- Rich with imagery, timeline-style storytelling, and emotional weight
- Full biography/interview content provided by the family (see `ike_riley_sr_tribute_content.md`)

### Scholarship

- **Official name:** "Ike Riley Sr Memorial Scholarship Program"
- Scholarship page will be **linked within the tribute page** (not a standalone top-level nav item)
- This saves space and keeps the scholarship emotionally tied to Coach's legacy

### Membership Structure (New Request)

- Members page needs a clear explanation of **what membership includes**
- Client is considering **two membership types or tiered structure:**
  - **Youth/Player Membership** — For kids directly involved in programs
  - **Supporter/Parent Membership** — For parents, families, community backers
- See `membership_structure.md` for the full proposed framework
