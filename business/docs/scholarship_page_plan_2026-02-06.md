### Section 1: About the Scholarship

Coach Ike Riley Sr. was raised in a single-parent home in poverty — no male role model, no college degree, no knowledge of God. Yet through faith, he became a man who never missed a game in 23 years, mentored hundreds of young men, and turned a $16K department into a $4M operation.

This scholarship continues his mission: **equipping young people who are ready to put in the work, stay on the right path, and serve their community.**

The Ike Riley Sr Memorial Scholarship is open to youth in the Chicagoland area who embody the WNQ pillars of **Integrity** and **Strength** — on and off the court.
