# Warriors Never Quit — Premium Website Migration

**Prepared by:** Setup Concierge  
**For:** Ike Riley, Warriors Never Quit  
**Date:** February 2026

---

## Why Upgrade?

Your current website runs on Wix. It works — but Wix comes with limitations that hold WNQ back:

| | Wix (Current) | Custom Site (Upgrade) |
|---|---|---|
| **Monthly cost** | $17–32/mo ($200–384/yr) | **$0/mo** — hosted free on GitHub Pages |
| **Page speed** | Slow — Wix adds bloat, ads, tracking | **Lightning fast** — clean code, no extras |
| **Design control** | Limited to Wix templates | **Unlimited** — every pixel is yours |
| **The Wix banner** | "This site was built with Wix" at the top | **Gone** — fully branded, fully yours |
| **SEO** | Basic Wix SEO tools | **Full control** — custom meta, schema, sitemap |
| **Ownership** | Wix owns the hosting | **You own everything** — code, domain, content |

### The Bottom Line

Wix costs WNQ **$200–384 per year** just to exist. The custom migration **pays for itself in Year 1** and saves money every year after.
