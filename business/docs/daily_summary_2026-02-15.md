# Daily Summary — Feb 15, 2026

## 🚀 Accomplishments

### 1. Unified Command Center Dashboard

- **Consolidated Business & Career Hubs**: Merged legacy content from `business/` and `career/` into a single, high-performance `index.html` in the root.
- **Lane Isolation**: Implemented strict lane filtering to prevent business actions from leaking into the career view.
- **Revenue Correction**: Fixed the revenue goal spotlight to reflect the current $400 session status (corrected from $2,000 placeholder).
- **Broken Link Repair**: Fixed the broken Roadmap link and verified all core navigation paths.

### 2. Technical Mastery & Career Prep

- **Siemens & PPCL Integration**: Added a dedicated technical prep section with conditional logic diagnostic tools and operator guide review tasks.
- **Interview Intelligence**: Ported dossiers for Gino Pisano, John Walters, and Michael Ester into the Career Hub view.

### 3. Workspace Organization (/organize-files)

- **Artifact Archival**: Moved legacy walkthroughs and summaries (Feb 08-13) into dedicated `Markdown` and `PDF` subfolders.
- **Registry Sync**: Updated `guides.html` to reflect the new file locations and added a "Session Logs" section for immediate retrieval.
- **Cleanup**: Deleted stale merge artifacts (`temp_business_index.html`).

### 4. Advisory Panel Review (/panel-review)

- **Full System Audit**: Mira, Aiden, Noa, and RayRay conducted a post-unification review.
- **Immediate Action**: Implemented urgency tags for WNQ Phase 1A monetization and verified mobile readability for long links.

### 5. Master Hub Hardening & Global Docs

- **Resolved 404 Errors**: Standardized global document paths (Master Playbook, Sterling Benefits, Brand Kit) and force-synced all PDF assets to GitHub Pages.
- **Synthesized Master Playbook**: Concatenated all 7 playbook chapters into a single `master_playbook.pdf` for one-click access.
- **Robust Deep Linking**: Hardened `#hash` navigation logic to prevent initialization collisions and support cross-hub deep links (e.g., `#career:prep_siemens`, `#registry`).
- **Onboarding Finalization**: Created a surgical `Sterling/Xenqu Onboarding Checklist` and integrated it into the Career Hub registry.
