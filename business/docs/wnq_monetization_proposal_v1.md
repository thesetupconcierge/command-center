### The Vision: A Legacy That Never Quits

Coach Ike Riley Sr. lived a life of struggle, sacrifice, and ultimate restoration. Whether it was his 23 years of never missing a game, or his rise from a janitor to a $4M manager through pure faith and integrity—his story is the heartbeat of this foundation.

Your current website functions, but it doesn't **speak**. The "Struggle Lion" logo represents these scars of resilience, but on the web, it's often small and static.

**We are proposing a digital transformation that makes the WNQ mission unmissable.**

### Phase 1: The Premium Custom Migration

We are moving WNQ off Wix and onto a **Custom-Built High-Performance Platform**.

| Feature | The Wix Status Quo | Your New Custom Foundation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Recurring Cost** | $200–$384 / year | **$0 / year** (Hosted free on GitHub) |
| **Page Speed** | Standard / Bloated | **Lightning Fast** (built for mobile) |
| **Narrative Design** | Template-locked | **Narrative-first** (The Lion's Scars Story) |
| **Ownership** | Renting from Wix | **You own 100% of the code** |

### Core Deliverables (14-Day Sprint)

1. **The "Museum" Tribute**: A photo-rich, timeline-driven legacy page for Coach Ike Riley Sr. featuring the "Our Father Prayer" ritual and deep-dive biography.
2. **Scholarship Activation**: A streamlined application and sponsorship page for the Ike Riley Sr. Memorial Scholarship.
3. **Modern Giving Engine**: Direct, frictionless donation integration with tiered giving levels and impact metrics.
4. **Mobile-First Hub**: A professional experience optimized for the 70%+ of your community browsing on their phones.
5. **Brand Pillar Strip**: Visual treatment for **Integrity, Strength, and Faith**.

| Item | Amount |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Nonprofit Digital Revamp (Premium Migration)** | **$3,500** |
| Returning Client Credit (Brand Photography) | **–$500** |
| **Total Investment** | **$3,000** |

### Why Now?

Coach didn't settle for "good enough," and WNQ shouldn't settle for a website that feels like a rental. By investing in this migration now, WNQ eliminates its software overhead forever and gains a professional foundation that matches the scale of the $4M department Coach built.

**"The scars tell the story. The mission carries the weight."**

### Next Steps

1. **Approve this proposal** by reply.
2. **Invoice for $1,500 deposit** will be sent immediately.
3. **Kickoff Call** scheduled for Feb 16 to lock final content.
