# Advisory Panel Response — Setup Concierge Website Review

**Date:** February 8, 2026  
**In Response To:** [Site Review — February 8, 2026](setupconcierge_site_review_2026-02-08.md)

---

## Question 1: Does the messaging resonate with the target audience?

*"Don't Let a Bad Setup Cost You Your Brand."*

---

### 🎯 Marcus Chen — Product Manager

> "The headline works because it leads with **pain**, not features. Creators and founders don't wake up thinking 'I need LLC formation' — they think 'I don't want to screw this up.' This nails that anxiety.
>
> One tweak: add a **subheadline** that pivots to aspiration. Something like: *'From formation to launch, we handle the details so you can build.'* Pain → relief → action."

### 📣 Nina Rodriguez — Marketing Manager

> "For founders — yes, it resonates. For creators — it's a little corporate. Creators respond more to *identity* and *vision*. Consider testing a variation like: *'Your brand deserves a proper foundation.'*
>
> The '20+ Comprehensive Services' stat is generic. Replace with something specific: *'47 businesses launched in 2025'* or *'Average client saves 60 hours on setup.'* Real numbers beat round numbers."

### 📈 Raymond Cross — Growth Advisor

> "It resonates, but it's doing two jobs at once — talking to people who *already know* they need help AND people who *don't know what they're missing*. For the second group, you need education content. Blog posts like 'The 7 Setup Mistakes That Kill New Brands' would funnel them in."

### 📊 Dr. Amara Okonkwo — Research & Data

> "We need data to answer this properly. I'd recommend:
>
> 1. **Hotjar or Microsoft Clarity** — see where visitors actually look and click
> 2. **A/B test** the headline against two alternatives
> 3. **Exit survey** — ask form abandoners *why* they left
>
> Gut feelings don't scale. Data does."

---

## Question 2: Are the three highlighted services the right ones to lead with?

*LLC Formation · Branding & Design · Website Development*

---

### 🎯 Marcus Chen — Product Manager

> "These are the right three because they map to the **natural sequence**: Legal → Visual Identity → Digital Presence. That 01-02-03 flow tells a story.
>
> But here's the miss: **where's the 04?** After the site is built, what's next? Consider adding '*04. Launch & Growth Support*' to signal an ongoing relationship, not a one-and-done transaction."

### 🧠 James Worthington — Business Strategist

> "LLC Formation is smart to lead with — it's the most anxiety-inducing step for new founders. But I'd reframe 'Branding & Design' to '**Brand Identity & Strategy**' — it implies deeper thinking, not just logos. That justifies higher pricing."

### 📣 Nina Rodriguez — Marketing Manager

> "The three are right, but the *descriptions* are too generic. Every agency says 'crafting visual identities.' What makes Setup Concierge different?
>
> Lead with the **concierge angle**: *'We don't just build your brand — we handle every detail so you don't have to.'* That's your competitive moat."

### 🔧 Derek Simmons — Ops Manager

> "From an ops perspective, these three create a clean service delivery pipeline. Each one has a clear start, deliverable, and end. That's operationally sound — easy to scope, price, and delegate."

---

## Question 3: What's missing that would convert more visitors?

---

### 📈 Raymond Cross — Growth Advisor

> "Three things, in order of impact:
>
> 1. **Social proof** — You need testimonials NOW. Even one quote from WNQ changes the conversion math. People buy what others have bought.
> 2. **Case study spotlight** — Show the WNQ journey: before → after. Real transformation beats any sales copy.
> 3. **Lead magnet** — That 'Launching Your Business Online' guide mockup I saw? Make it downloadable in exchange for an email. Build the list."

### 📱 Jasmine Taylor — Social Media Manager

> "The site has zero social proof from social platforms. Add:
>
> - Instagram feed embed showing your work
> - A 'Featured In' or 'Clients' logo bar
> - Short video testimonials (even 15-second phone clips work)
>
> The most underrated conversion tool is a **behind-the-scenes video** of you setting up a client. Show the process."

### 🎨 Maya Chen — Visual Designer

> "The design is solid, but it lacks **micro-interactions**. When someone hovers over a service card, it should expand or animate subtly. The 'Get Started' button should pulse gently or have a hover glow. These details signal premium quality.
>
> Also — add a **portfolio/gallery** section. You're offering design and web services. Show the work."

### 🏗️ Victor Oduya — Project Architect

> "The intake form link is buried in the footer. It should be:
>
> 1. In the hero section CTA
> 2. After each service description
> 3. As a sticky floating button
>
> Every scroll position should have a clear path to that form. Reduce friction to zero."

---

## Question 4: Should pricing be visible on the homepage?

---

### 💰 Evelyn Tran — Financial Strategist

> "**Yes, but strategically.** Don't list exact prices — list *'starting at'* ranges. This does three things:
>
> 1. Filters out tire-kickers who can't afford you
> 2. Anchors expectations so the intake call is smoother
> 3. Signals transparency, which builds trust
>
> Suggested format: 'LLC Formation — Starting at $299 · Branding — Starting at $799 · Websites — Starting at $1,499'"

### 🧠 James Worthington — Business Strategist

> "I'd push back on visible pricing for now. You're a **concierge** service — that implies custom. The moment you put prices up, you commoditize yourself. Instead, use: *'Custom packages tailored to your needs — book a free consultation.'*
>
> Pricing works when you have volume. You're in the relationship-building phase."

### 📈 Raymond Cross — Growth Advisor

> "Show pricing. Hide pricing. It doesn't matter as much as people think. What matters is **reducing the next step's friction**. The question isn't 'should I show prices?' — it's 'how fast can someone go from curiosity to conversation?'
>
> My vote: show price *ranges* on a dedicated Services page, but keep the homepage focused on the intake form CTA."

### ⚖️ Cassandra Wells — Legal Counsel

> "If you do publish prices, include a disclaimer: *'Pricing is for standard engagements. Complex structures may require a custom quote.'* This protects you from scope disputes."
