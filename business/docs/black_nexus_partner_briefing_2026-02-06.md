## 💰 Equity & Profit Structure

| Aspect | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| **Profit Split** | 50% you / 50% me — equal partners in earnings |
| **Voting Rights** | Major decisions require agreement; day-to-day handled by Managing Member |
| **Vesting** | Your 50% vests over 2 years — this protects both of us |
| **Distributions** | Profits paid out quarterly (or as agreed) after expenses |

### What is Vesting?

Vesting means you earn your ownership stake over time. If you left after 6 months, you'd have 25% of your shares vested. After 2 years, you're fully vested at 50%.

**Why?** This ensures commitment from both sides and protects the company if life happens.
