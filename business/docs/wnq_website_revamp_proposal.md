# Warriors Never Quit Foundation

## Website Revamp Proposal

**Prepared by:** Setup Concierge · J4AFoundation LLC
**Date:** February 12, 2026
**Prepared for:** Warriors Never Quit Foundation Board of Directors

## The Opportunity

Warriors Never Quit has a powerful mission — but your current website isn't telling that story. Visitors can't easily understand what WNQ does, donating is harder than it should be, and mobile users get a diminished experience.

We're proposing a complete digital revamp that matches your mission's impact.
