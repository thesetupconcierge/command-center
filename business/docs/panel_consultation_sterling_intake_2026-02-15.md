# Advisory Panel Consultation — Sterling Onboarding & Financial Strategy

**Date:** February 15, 2026  
**Subject:** High-Value Intake: Building Systems Engineer ($60/hr)  
**Goal:** Maximize stable income from Sterling Engineering to accelerate the BEAF ecosystem without operational burnout.

## 🏛️ Panel Opening (Darius Cole — Ops Director)

"Justice, this is a massive win. A stable $60/hr baseline ($124,800/year gross) changes the game from 'surviving' to 'scaling.' However, the high-demand nature of a Building Systems Engineer role (40+ hours/week) creates a high risk of 'founder fatigue.' We must operationalize your personal life as strictly as we do your code."

## 💰 Financial Allocation Strategy (Evelyn Tran — Financial Strategist)

"Based on the $60/hr rate and March 2 start date, we now have a predictable 'Capital Engine.' My recommendations for the first 90 days:"

1. **The 50/30/20 Shield:**
    - **50% Fixed Costs/Savings**: Personal stability first.
    - **30% Black Nexus R&D**: This becomes your seed fund for partner bounties, API credits (Gemini, V8 Engine), and marketing.
    - **20% Reinvestment**: Buy back your time.
2. **Revenue Tracker Implementation:**
    - The dashboard widget should show 'Business Projected Revenue' vs. 'Baseline Career Revenue.'
    - **Goal:** Reach a point where Business Revenue exceeds 50% of Career Revenue before Phase 3.

## 📈 Leveraging Velocity (Aiden Shah — Revenue Strategist)

"With a stable $60/hr, you should no longer be doing $15/hr tasks. Use the cash flow to buy velocity."

1. **Outsource Low-Value Tasks:** Immediately budget for a freelance Graphic Designer or Video Editor to handle the 'Story Vault' production for Black Nexus.
2. **Value-Based Bounties:** Use a portion of the Sterling income to fund JB’s 'Success Fees' for specific coding milestones. This keeps the partner incentivized even when you are heads-down on-site for Sterling.

## 🔬 Path Isolation & Compliance (Cassandra Wells — Legal Counsel)

"Path isolation is non-negotiable. Sterling/AbbVie is a 'Clinical Engineering' engagement; Black Nexus is your 'Diagnostic Lab.'"

1. **Hardware DMZ:** Use a dedicated laptop for Sterling work. Never, under any circumstances, commit code to the `blacknexuscda` org or the V8 Engine repo from a Sterling machine.
2. **Intellectual Property:** Ensure your Sterling contract doesn't have overreaching IP clauses. Your 'Diagnostic Rigor' and 'Surgical Logic' are Setup Concierge assets, not AbbVie's.

## 👔 Synthesis (Darius Cole)

"The 'Surgical Standard' must be applied to your calendar. With 40 hours committed to Sterling, your 'Creative Dev' hours for Black Nexus must be **Deep Work only**. No admin, no folder renaming—Antigravity handles that."

### **Panel Recommendations:**

- [ ] **Prototype the Revenue Tracker** to show 'Ecosystem Growth' (Career + Business).
- [ ] **Draft a '90-Day Time-Shield'** — specific hours of the day where Sterling cannot bleed into Nexus work.
- [ ] **Establish an 'Investment Ledger'** in the `Finances` folder to track how Sterling income is fueling V8 Engine development.
