# /panel-review: Strategic Pivot & System Hardening [PRIVATE: SC ONLY]

**Date**: February 17, 2026
**Scope**: Full System Audit (Strategic Pivot focus)
**Panelists**: Darius Cole (Ops), Mira Voss (Workflow), Aiden Shah (Revenue)

---

## 👔 Darius Cole — Ops Director

### ✅ Strengths

- **Team Readiness**: The "Diagnostic Alpha" shell successfully delegates high-value labor to Sprint Command (Aiden/Ray/Noa).
- **Protocol Clarity**: Article 05 provides the necessary legal/operational buffer for the Advisory Panel.

### ⚠️ Friction Points

- **Justice Dependency**: While the shell exists, the *assignment* of the shell still depends on Justice. We need a trigger-based assignment system.

### 🔧 Recommendations

- **NOW**: Standardize the "Diagnostic Alpha" as the mandatory starting point for all Phase 1 engagements.

## 🧭 Mira Voss — Workflow Strategist

### ✅ Strengths

- **Registry Hygiene**: The date-based sorting and Value Essence archival have significantly reduced navigation friction.
- **Heartbeat Automation**: The 5-minute sync heartbeat removes manual "Gist-Anxiety."

### ⚠️ Friction Points

- **CSS Sprawl**: Dashboard styling is currently split between `hub-core.css` and potential inline remnants.

### 🔧 Recommendations

- **NEXT**: Consolidate all dashboard UI logic into a single "Command Core" stylesheet to prevent rendering lag.

## 📊 Aiden Shah — Revenue Strategist

### ✅ Strengths

- **Pricing Hardening**: The shift to $7,500/$2,500 (CBRE) and $5,000 (WNQ) anchors significantly increases ecosystem margin.
- **Discount Purge**: Removing the "Returning Client Credit" re-establishes Setup Concierge as a "Clinical Standard" provider.

### ⚠️ Friction Points

- **Billing Telemetry**: We lack a way to see real-time payment status on the dashboard (manual entry only).

### 🔧 Recommendations

- **LATER**: Investigate a read-only integration for revenue tracking (e.g., Stripe/Quickbooks) to automate the Revenue Ring.

## 🏁 Executive Synthesis (Darius)

The system is now **strategically hardened**. We have moved from "Freelance Mindset" to "Clinical Agency." The #1 priority is now **Activation**: We must deploy the "Diagnostic Alpha" shell into the CBRE environment immediately to prove the delegable labor model.
