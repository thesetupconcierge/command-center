# Full System Audit — Sprint Command Review (Feb 2026)

**Activation Roster:** Darius Cole (D), Mira Voss (M), Aiden Shah (A), Noa Chen (N), RayRay Navarro (R)
**Supervisor:** Derek Simmons

---

## 👔 Darius Cole — Ops Director

**Lens:** "Is this team structured to win?"

### ✅ Strengths

- **Centralized Orchestration**: The Master Hub unification eliminates the "multi-repo stutter." Having a single engine for both Business and Career lanes is a strategic win.
- **Forensic Accountability**: The implementation of the `forensic-ledger.md` establishes a proper audit trail for clinical anomalies.

### ⚠️ Friction Points

- **Role Disambiguation**: The "Surgical Scripting Lab" is a great addition, but we need to be clear if this is for Justice's personal skill-building or a protocol for external collaborators like JB.

### 🔧 Recommendations

- **NOW**: Formally link the Clinical OS protocol to the Black Nexus onboarding track to ensure shared standard.

## 🧭 Mira Voss — System Coherence Officer

**Lens:** "Does every part of this system know what the other parts are doing?"

### ✅ Strengths

- **Protocol Promotion**: Moving the DDIA mapping to the Playbook core (`clinical-architecture.md`) correctly elevates technical strategy to an operational standard.
- **Deep Link Navigation**: Hash-based routing (`#mode:section`) ensures that external docs (like this review) point directly to actionable areas.

### ⚠️ Friction Points

- **Gist Duality**: We are still syncing two separate Gists. While good for isolation, we need a "Global Sync" check to ensure no lane drift.

### 🔧 Recommendations

- **NEXT**: Implement a "System Health" check in the `/morning` routine that validates Gist sync timestamps for both lanes simultaneously.

## 📊 Aiden Shah — Revenue Strategist

**Lens:** "Is money flowing in the right direction?"

### ✅ Strengths

- **Financial Visibility**: The "Clinical Finance" card in the Business lane brings "Burn vs. Income" to the center of the engine.
- **Anchoring Psychology**: The WNQ $3k goal is front-and-center, keeping the team focused on the Feb 27 milestone.

### ⚠️ Friction Points

- **Revenue Lab Gaps**: The "Surgical Scripting" lab currently lacks a "Monetization" track. How do these coding skills turn into dollars?

### 🔧 Recommendations

- **LATER**: Add a "Value-Based Scripting" module that teaches how to build automation that clients (like WNQ) would pay a premium for.

---

## 🎨 Noa Chen — Creative & Brand Director

**Lens:** "Does this look, feel, and communicate like a premium service?"

### ✅ Strengths

- **Context Recognition**: The Gold (Business) vs. Cyan (Career) theme shifts provide instant high-contrast context recognition.
- **Pulse UX**: The section highlight animation for deep links adds a clinical, high-tech "ping" that reinforces the CDA brand.

### ⚠️ Friction Points

- **Inline Style Debt**: The Hub code is accumulating inline styles (`style="..."`). This makes the "engine" harder to modify for future skinning.

### 🔧 Recommendations

- **NEXT**: Extract Hub UI styles into a dedicated `hub-core.css` file to maintain a cleaner "Playbook-First" code structure.

---

## 🛡️ RayRay Navarro — QA & Compactor

**Lens:** "Can you find what you need in under 10 seconds?"

### ✅ Strengths

- **Surgical Cleanup**: The `/organize-files` run successfully purged the "junk drawer" files (legacy fragments) into the `.agent` archive.
- **Link Integrity**: The promotion of the Strategy doc was followed by a surgical update of the Hub's header links. 10/10 execution.

### ⚠️ Friction Points

- **Mobile Density**: The new Finance and Scripting cards increase the vertical scroll. We may need "Collapse All" functionality for mobile views.

### 🔧 Recommendations

- **NOW**: Run a test on an actual iPhone to ensure the "Deep Link" highlight doesn't get obscured by sticky headers.

## 🎯 Cross-Panel Synthesis (Darius Brief)

The system has moved from "Segmented Hubs" to a "Unified Engineering Engine." We have high scores on **Visibility** (Aiden) and **Vibe** (Noa). **Integrity** (RayRay) is strong after the hygiene run. The #1 priority is **Consolidation of Workflow Debt**—ensuring that all our new "Labs" and "Ledgers" are integrated into our daily rituals (`/morning`, `/consolidate`).

**System Grade: A- (Surgical)**
