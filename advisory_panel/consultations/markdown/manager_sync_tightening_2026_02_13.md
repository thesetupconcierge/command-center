# Manager Sync: Operational Tightening

**Date:** February 13, 2026
**Participants:** 👔 Derek Simmons (Ops Supervisor), 👔 Darius Cole (Ops Director)

## 💬 Context Sync

Derek and Darius have reviewed the recent session milestones and agreed on the following "tightening" of the Setup Concierge OS.

### 1. The "SC Only" Distinction (Admin Layer)

**Darius:** *"Justice is right—SC Only is the 'Admin' and 'Command' work. It's where the strategy is baked. JB needs the output (the tasks), not the recipe (the panel brainstorming). We keep the strategic noise in the private folder."*
**Derek:** *"Agreed. My job is to filter the General Advisory 'vibes' into clinical implementation tasks for the shared repo. If it's about governance or revenue, it's SC Private. If it's about code or design, it's Shared."*

### 2. "Push One, Push All" (Safety Protocol)

**Derek:** *"We're encoding the multi-repo sync into the daily consolidation. We move as one unit. If we rebrand in private, we push the rebrand in shared simultaneously. No version drift."*

### 3. The Clinical Diagnostic (Quality Gate)

**Darius:** *"I'm holding the line on the 10-second rule. Every shared commit must be findable and readable. No messy 'temp' work. We are a Clinical Development Agency now; the hygiene must match."*

## 🏁 Resolution

Workflows `/consolidate` and `/panel-review` have been updated to reflect these management directives.
