# Proposal: The Strategic "Fold-In" Protocol

**Flag:** 🔴 [PRIVATE: SETUP CONCIERGE ONLY]

## 🎯 The Objective

To elevate the General Advisory Panel from "Passive Experts" to **"Active Strategic Guardians"** who have the power to influence the shared Black Nexus roadmap without ever being exposed directly to external partners.

## 🏛️ The Four Power Levels of the Panel

We are defining how "Private Counsel" becomes "Operational Law":

### Level 1: Strategic Suggestion (Low Friction)

- **Source:** Individual General Advisor (e.g., Nina suggesting a font change).
- **Execution:** Justice reviews and decides.
- **Workflow:** Darius logs it in the private `panel_audit_*.md`.

### Level 2: Optimization Directive (Medium Friction)

- **Source:** Sprint Command (e.g., Mira spotting a workflow redundancy).
- **Execution:** Derek translates this into a "Shared Task" for JB.
- **Workflow:** Added to the shared `BN Roadmap`.

### Level 3: Binding Strategic Directive (BSD) (High Friction)

- **Source:** Consensus of 3+ General Advisors or a Lead (e.g., Victor & Evelyn flagging a legal/tax risk).
- **Execution:** This is a **MANDATORY** operational change. The shared sprint is paused until the directive is satisfied.
- **Workflow:** Derek issues a "Surgical Pause" in the shared `command-center`.

### Level 4: The Sovereign Veto (Nuclear)

- **Source:** Justice (Founder) + Advisory Recommendation.
- **Execution:** Immediate termination of a project lane, partner contract, or product feature.
- **Governance:** Defined in Article 1 of the Collaboration Charter.

## ⚡ The "Fold-In" Workflow (The Bridge)

1. **Strategic Intent:** General Advisory meets (Private).
2. **Diagnostic Filter:** Derek Simmons (Ops Supervisor) reviews the findings.
3. **Operational Translation:** Derek strips the "Personality" (who said it) and the "Private Context" (why SC needs it) out of the advice.
4. **Binding Directive:** Derek posts the "Clinical Directive" to the shared repo.

**Example:**

- *General Advisory Says:* "JB's current code structure is too loose for the $3K/month tier we want to hit." (PRIVATE)
- *Derek Posts to Shared:* "Surgical Alignment Required: Roadmap items #12-14 require strict Standard Library compliance to satisfy CDA Quality Tier 1." (SHARED)

## 📌 Next Steps

If this "proper fold in" makes sense, I will update the **Governance Charter** to include **Article 5: Strategic Implementation Gateways**, formalizing this power.

> [!TIP]
> This keeps you in the "Visionary" seat while Derek acts as the "Enforcement" layer using the panel's combined intelligence.
