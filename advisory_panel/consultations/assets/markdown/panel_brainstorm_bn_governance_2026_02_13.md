## 🏛️ Governance & Structure (Darius Cole)

"A partnership without clear lanes is just a slow train wreck. Justice is the Founder/Visionary, JB is the Implementation Partner. We need to define exactly who makes which calls."

- **The Veto Rule:** Justice retains 100% veto power over brand-facing decisions for Black Nexus.
- **The Implementation Lane:** JB has autonomy over technical implementation details (the "how") as long as they meet the "10-Second Rule" and Setup Concierge [Playbook](../playbook/README.md) standards.
- **Escalation Protocol:** Technical blockers go to Justice; Brand/Strategic conflicts go to the Advisory Panel (Derek).

## ⚖️ Legal & IP Guardrails (Cassandra Wells)

"We are dealing with the 'V8 Engine'—a high-value proprietary asset. Governance must protect the 'Secret Sauce' while allowing the agency to thrive."

- **IP Separation:** The V8 Engine and Setup Concierge core logic remain 100% owned by J4AFoundation LLC. Black Nexus LLC is a *user* and *reseller* of these capabilities.
- **Work-for-Hire:** All code produced by JB in the `blacknexuscda` organization must be legally assigned to Black Nexus LLC (or J4A), not held in personal accounts.
- **Revenue Split (First-Dollar):** Establish a simple, milestone-based split. Avoid complex equity conversations until Phase 4 (Go-to-Market).

## 🧭 Workflow & Coherence (Mira Voss)

"Communication is where partnerships bleed money. We need a 'Communication SOP' that prevents over-explaining."

- **Surgical Commits:** No "fixed bugs" commit messages. JB must follow the surgical commit protocol defined in [04-git-strategy](04-git-strategy.md).
- **The "Done" Definition:** A task isn't "done" until it's verified by Antigravity and reported in the Captain's Log.
- **Office Hours vs. Async:** Establish a 2-hour daily window for high-bandwidth alignment; all other work must be documented asynchronously via the dashboard.

## 📊 Revenue & Incentives (Aiden Shah)

"JB needs 'Short-Term Wins' to stay hungry. Long-term equity is a dream; cash is the reality."

- **Bounty System:** Instead of a flat salary, use a "Bounty" model for the first 3 clients. Each task in the roadmap should have a hypothetical "Value Score" (Impact) to track contribution.
- **The "First-Dollar" Milestone:** The first revenue generated through a Black Nexus deliverable should trigger a predefined "Success Fee" for the implementation partner.

## 👔 Ops Synthesis (Derek Simmons)

"My job is to ensure Justice stays in 'Owner Mode' while JB stays in 'Builder Mode.' I will monitor the collaboration logs to flag when Justice is getting too deep into the technical weeds."

**Actionable Recommendations (Governance Charter):**

1. **The "Single Source of Truth":** The shared `command-center` dashboard is the *only* place where priorities are set. No DM-based requests.
2. **Weekly Retrospective:** Every Friday, Derek (AI-channeled) will audit the repo and provide a "Collaboration Pulse" report to Justice.
3. **The "Exit" Clause:** Establish a no-fault exit strategy if the partnership doesn't reach Phase 2 within 60 days.

*Brainstorming complete. Next Step: Draft the formal 'Black Nexus Collaboration Charter' based on these findings.*
