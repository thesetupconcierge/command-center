# Advisory Panel Refinement — Event Photography Website Update

**Date:** February 8, 2026  
**In Response To:** [Website Photography Update Proposal](website_photography_update_proposal_2026-02-08.md)  
**Objective:** Refine for maximum conversion and results

---

## Question 1: Pricing — Are the tiers positioned correctly?

---

### 💰 Evelyn Tran — Financial Strategist

> "The pricing structure is smart, but I'd adjust the anchoring:
>
> **Single Event at $500** — This is your entry point. Good. But don't say 'starting at' — say **'from $500.'** It reads more confident.
>
> **Quarterly at $1,700** — The 15% discount math doesn't obviously work out ($500 × 4 = $2,000, 15% off = $1,700). That's fine, but **show the savings explicitly**: *'$1,700/quarter (save $300 vs. single bookings).'* People need to SEE the deal.
>
> **Annual at $5,500** — Same thing. Show it: *'$5,500/year (save $1,500 vs. à la carte).'*
>
> **Critical addition:** Add a **'Most Popular'** badge to the Quarterly tier. It creates social proof and nudges people toward the middle option — that's where your sweet spot is."

### 📈 Raymond Cross — Growth Advisor

> "Price with confidence. $500 for 3 hours of professional photography with edited deliverables is **below market** in Chicago. Most event photographers charge $750-1,200 for comparable packages.
>
> My refinement:
>
> - **Single Event:** $600 (positions you as professional, not budget)
> - **Quarterly:** $2,000 ($600 × 4 = $2,400, you save them $400)
> - **Annual:** $6,500 ($600 × 12 = $7,200, you save them $700)
>
> You can always run a 'first-time client' discount at $500 to capture initial leads. But don't anchor your brand at the lowest possible price."

### 📊 Dr. Amara Okonkwo — Research & Data

> "Before finalizing prices, run a quick competitive scan:
>
> - Search 'event photographer Chicago pricing' and document 5 competitors
> - Note their starting prices and what's included
> - Position Setup Concierge in the **top 30%** — you're not competing on price, you're competing on the concierge experience
>
> Also: track the **conversion rate per tier** once live. If everyone picks Single Event, the Quarterly isn't compelling enough. If everyone picks Annual, you may be underpriced."

## Question 2: Copy — Professional vs. approachable balance?

---

### 📣 Nina Rodriguez — Marketing Manager

> "The copy is good but needs more **personality**. Right now it reads like every other photography service. Here are my refinements:
>
> **Service card (DON'T say):**
> *'Professional coverage that captures your brand in action.'*
>
> **Service card (DO say):**
> *'We show up, capture the magic, and deliver scroll-stopping content before your event buzz fades.'*
>
> **The hero subheadline (DON'T say):**
> *'From business formation to event coverage — we handle every detail so you don't have to.'*
>
> **The hero subheadline (DO say):**
> *'We build your brand, design your presence, and capture every moment — so you can focus on what you do best.'*
>
> **Why?** Your audience is **founders and creators**. They respond to energy and vision, not corporate polish. Talk like a trusted partner, not a vendor."

### 🎨 Maya Chen — Visual Designer

> "The page needs a **visual hierarchy upgrade**:
>
> 1. **Lead with the work.** Put a full-bleed hero image at the top of the photography page — an actual event photo you've shot. No stock. Authenticity converts.
> 2. **Package cards** should have subtle visual differentiation — the Annual card should feel more premium (gold accent border, slightly larger, or a background tint).
> 3. **Add icons** to the deliverables table. A camera icon for photos, a phone icon for social crops, a film icon for reels. Scannability matters."

---

## Question 3: Packages — Right deliverables?

---

### 📱 Jasmine Taylor — Social Media Manager

> "The deliverables are solid, but you're missing the **highest-value item** for modern clients:
>
> **Add 'Social Media Content Kit' to every tier:**
>
> - 5-10 pre-captioned Instagram posts with hashtag sets
> - 3 Instagram Story-ready vertical crops
> - 1 carousel-ready set (10 images, branded)
>
> This is worth $200+ by itself, and it's what clients actually NEED the most. Most photographers deliver a gallery and say 'good luck.' You deliver **ready-to-post content**. That's your competitive moat.
>
> Also — the 48-hour turnaround for social selects is a **killer feature**. Promote this harder. Most photographers take 2-3 weeks. You delivering same-week content is a massive differentiator."

### 🏗️ Victor Oduya — Project Architect

> "Structure refinement for the packages:
>
> **Add a 'What Happens Next' section** after the pricing:
>
> 1. Book a free consultation
> 2. We learn your brand and event goals
> 3. Show up and capture
> 4. Receive your edited gallery + social kit
>
> This mirrors the 01-02-03-04 flow on the homepage and creates **process consistency** across the brand. Clients want to know what happens after they click 'Get Started.'"

### 🔧 Derek Simmons — Ops Manager

> "Two operational additions:
>
> 1. **Booking lead time requirement** — Add a note: *'We recommend booking at least 2 weeks in advance. Rush bookings available for Quarterly and Annual clients.'* This manages expectations and incentivizes retainers.
>
> 2. **Cancelation policy** — Brief but clear: *'Cancellations with less than 48 hours notice are subject to a 50% booking fee.'* This protects your time. Don't be shy about it — professional services have terms."

---

## Question 4: Page structure — Optimized for conversion?

---

### 🎯 Marcus Chen — Product Manager

> "The page structure should follow the **AIDA framework** (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action):
>
> 1. **Hero image + headline** (Attention) — Full-bleed event photo, bold headline
> 2. **What You Get** (Interest) — Deliverables table
> 3. **Packages** (Desire) — Three tiers with Most Popular badge
> 4. **Social proof** (Desire+) — WNQ testimonial or case study teaser
> 5. **CTA** (Action) — *'Ready to Capture Your Next Event?'* → Intake form button
>
> Currently your proposal puts deliverables before packages, which is correct. But **add a CTA button after EVERY section**, not just at the bottom. Every scroll position should have an exit to the intake form."

### 🧠 James Worthington — Business Strategist

> "One strategic concern: **don't let photography overshadow your core setup services.** The homepage should still lead with LLC + Branding + Web as the primary story. Photography is the **proof point** — it shows you're a full-service partner, not just a contractor.
>
> My refinement: frame the 4th pillar as **'Ongoing Brand Support'** instead of just photography. This is the umbrella for:
>
> - Event photography
> - Content creation
> - Brand maintenance
> - Future services you add
>
> This way, as you expand your service offerings, the homepage doesn't need restructuring every time."

---

## Question 5: Integration with existing homepage

---

### ⚖️ Cassandra Wells — Legal Counsel

> "Quick legal note: if you're offering photography packages, your **service agreement template** needs updating to include:
>
> - Image usage rights (commercial vs. editorial)
> - Model release provisions (people photographed at events)
> - Delivery timeline commitments
> - Raw file ownership clauses
>
> I can draft these additions. Budget $200-300 for the template update."

### 📝 Sarah Okonjo — Documentation Manager

> "Integration checklist for the homepage:
>
> - [ ] Add 4th service card (or rename to 'Ongoing Brand Support')
> - [ ] Update hero subheadline
> - [ ] Create `/event-photography` page
> - [ ] Add WNQ case study section
> - [ ] Update footer navigation
> - [ ] Update Services page with photography packages
> - [ ] Update intake form to include photography options
>
> Each of these is a discrete WordPress edit. Estimate 2-3 hours total for implementation."
