**Date:** February 12, 2026
**Context:** Sprint Command triage of all 12 active NEXT_ACTIONS items

---

## 📱 Mobile-Doable (Do These On Your Phone)

These require only texts, emails, browser, or GitHub Mobile:

| ID | Action | How |
|---|---|---|
| **a1** | Send JB project brief + collaboration guide PDFs | 📧 Email from phone — PDFs are in `command-center/business/docs/` (accessible via guides page) |
| **a2** | Confirm JB accepted GitHub org invite | 🌐 Check `github.com/orgs/blacknexuscda/people` in Safari |
| **a13** | Send WNQ formal proposal with 50/50 payment terms | 📧 Email to Ike — proposal PDF viewable from business guides page |
| **a14** | Collect 50% upfront ($1,500) — add hard deadline | 📱 Text/call Ike to confirm payment date after sending proposal |

> **⚡ These are all NOW-urgency items.** You can knock out 4 action items from your phone right now.

## 💻 Terminal / Desktop Required

These need code editing, CLI tools, or file system access:

| ID | Action | Why Desktop |
|---|---|---|
| **a3** | Create ClickUp task from template | 🖥️ Copy markdown template content into ClickUp — easier on desktop |
| **a4** | Enable branch protection on command-center main | ⚙️ GitHub Settings → Branches → Add rule (can do mobile but fiddly) |
| **a9** | Build WNQ website using /build-site pipeline | 🔧 Full dev workflow — terminal, Vite, code editing |
| **a10** | Create WNQ Case Study | ✍️ Writing doc + screenshots — better on desktop |
| **a11** | Build Setup Concierge landing page | 🔧 Full dev workflow — code, design, deploy |
| **a12** | Outreach to 10 nonprofits with WNQ case study | 📋 Needs case study done first (a10) — then batch email from desktop |

---

## 📦 Backlog (Lower Priority)

| ID | Action | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **a7** | Upgrade Career Hub to match SC dashboard | ✅ **Partially done** — guides page just shipped. Next Actions section still todo. |
| **a8** | Update Career Hub with thank-you email file | 💻 Desktop — quick file copy + commit |
