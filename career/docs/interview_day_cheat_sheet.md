## Your Opening Line

*"I've operated Siemens Apogee and Insight BAS in a mission-critical, 2.1-million-square-foot data center — managing 63 chillers, 48 AHUs, and 135 CRAHs across 18 data halls. I understand what 'no downtime' means, and I'm ready to bring that discipline to a pharmaceutical environment where the stakes are even higher."*

## 🛡️ Gap Responses (Memorize These)

**"Have you written PPCL code?"**
> "I've operated systems running PPCL logic and understand the sequence of operations. I've studied PPCL syntax — I'm eager to go deeper, and I'd welcome the chance to learn from Gino's hands-on expertise."

**"Do you have Desigo CC experience?"**
> "Not directly, but I know it's the successor to Insight/Apogee. My track record is picking up new platforms fast — I went from zero to console operator on Delta Controls EnteliWEB in my first months at CyrusOne."

**"Why leave data centers for pharma?"**
> "Pharma is a higher-stakes, more nuanced challenge — maintaining environments that affect drug safety and human health. That responsibility level appeals to me."
