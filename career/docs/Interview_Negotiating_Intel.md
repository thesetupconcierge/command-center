# 🎙️ Surgical Interview Tactics: The Negotiation Intel

> "The interview is not an exam; it's a negotiation where the product is your skills. Control the narrative, or let them write it for you."

## 🎭 The Narrative Pivot

Don't be a "candidate" — be a **Negotiator**.

### 1. 💰 Salary Arbitrage

- **The Intel**: HR is incentivized to find top talent at the floor price.
- **The Tactic**: Never reveal your true previous salary if you're seeking a significant leap. Provide the "value range" you are negotiating for, not the historical floor.

### 2. 🚪 The "Forward Motion" Exit

- **The Intel**: Badmouthing a previous environment flags you as a "difficult person."
- **The Tactic**: Even if the previous office was toxic, the reason for leaving is **always** "seeking higher professional challenges." Focus on where you are going, not what you are fleeing.

### 3. 🛡️ The Tyrant Shield

- **The Intel**: Criticizing a former boss (even a known tyrant) makes you look incapable of leadership/cooperation in a new context.
- **The Tactic**: Maintain absolute professional neutrality regarding former leadership.

### 4. 📅 The 10-Year Illusion

- **The Intel**: Companies want long-term bets. Admitting a "farm with cows" dream early on signals a lack of commitment.
- **The Tactic**: Align your 5-10 year vision with the company's growth. Signal commitment to the "future with them" while keeping personal exits private.

### 5. 👑 Humble Leadership

- **The Intel**: Top professionals often self-sabotage by over-sharing credit.
- **The Tactic**: Stop saying "I didn't do it alone." Start saying: **"We faced problems along the way, but we managed to solve them."** This positions you as the leader of the solution.

## 📈 CV Marketing (The 5-Second Rule)

Your CV is a marketing brochure, not a biography.

- **Sync the Online/Offline**: If you're doing "amazing things" on social media/GitHub, your CV must reflect that *immediately*.
- **Sell the Result**: Treat the CV as a 5-second pitch. Highlight the **Money Shots** (results, metrics, solutions) at the very top.
- **No Excuses**: Use modern tools to ensure the design is premium. A stale CV suggests a stale engineer.

> Above all: **Believe in the Value.** There is always a buyer for your specific skill set, but you must know how to sell it so they can find you.
