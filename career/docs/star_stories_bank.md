## STAR 1: "Tell me about a time you managed a critical system under pressure"

**Target Interviewer:** John Walters (project delivery) / Michael Ester (reliability)

**Situation:** At CyrusOne's 2.1 million square-foot data center campus in Chicago, I was the console operator responsible for monitoring the Siemens Apogee and Insight BAS across 18 data halls — covering 63 chillers, 48 AHUs, and 135 CRAHs.

**Task:** During a severe summer heat event, outdoor temperatures exceeded the design threshold. Multiple chiller alarms triggered simultaneously across several data halls, and the BAS was showing temperature exceedances approaching customer SLA limits.

**Action:** I immediately triaged the alarms through the Siemens Insight console, identifying which data halls were most critical based on customer tier. I coordinated with the mechanical team to manually override chiller staging sequences via the BAS, redirected chilled water flow to the highest-priority halls, and simultaneously opened MCIM tickets to document every action taken in real time for compliance.

**Result:** We maintained all Tier 1 customer SLAs. Zero downtime tickets issued. My documented response sequence was later adopted as the standard MOP for heat event escalation across the campus. This kind of disciplined, BAS-driven emergency response is exactly what a pharmaceutical facility needs.

## STAR 2: "Describe a situation where you quickly learned a new system or technology"

**Target Interviewer:** Gino Pisano (technical depth) / Michael Ester (learning legacy)

**Situation:** When I joined CyrusOne, their facility ran multiple BAS platforms — Siemens Apogee and Insight were the primaries, but some areas also used Delta Controls EnteliWEB and TAC/IA Enterprise Server.

**Task:** I needed to become proficient on all four platforms to effectively monitor and respond to alarms campus-wide. There was no single operator manual — each system had its own interface, alarm logic, and nomenclature.

**Action:** I created my own cross-reference guide mapping alarm types across platforms, shadowed senior technicians on each system, and volunteered for night shifts where I could practice navigating each interface under real conditions without the pressure of peak operations. I also enrolled in the Pneumatic & Digital Controls course at Triton College through Local 399 to strengthen my technical foundation.

**Result:** Within 3 months I was cleared as a solo console operator on all four platforms. My cross-reference guide was eventually shared with new hires as part of onboarding. This multi-platform fluency is directly relevant here — if AbbVie is transitioning from Insight to Desigo CC, I've been through platform migrations before and I know how to operate in a mixed-system environment.

## STAR 3: "Give an example of how you ensured documentation and compliance"

**Target Interviewer:** John Walters (process) / All (pharma = GxP compliance)

**Situation:** At Microsoft's data center, every maintenance activity required a Method of Procedure (MOP) to be written, reviewed, and approved before any work could begin — even for routine filter changes on AHUs.

**Task:** As an L4 Critical Environment Technician, I was responsible for both writing MOPs for my own work and reviewing MOPs submitted by third-party vendors before they could enter the facility.

**Action:** I developed a personal checklist system for MOP review that verified: scope of work, safety isolation points, rollback procedures, estimated duration, and impacted systems. For my own MOPs, I included detailed step-by-step procedures with clear decision trees for contingencies. I also maintained our Corrigo ticketing system with real-time status updates so the operations manager always had visibility into active work.

**Result:** Over my tenure, I maintained a 100% MOP compliance rate with zero unapproved changes. Two of my MOP templates were adopted as team standards. In a pharmaceutical GxP environment like AbbVie, this kind of documentation discipline isn't just good practice — it's regulatory requirement. I'm already wired to operate that way.

## STAR 4: "Tell me about a time you worked effectively with a team"

**Target Interviewer:** John Walters (team fit) / Michael Ester (respect for tenure)

**Situation:** At the Palmer House Hilton, a historic hotel in downtown Chicago, I was on a small building engineering team responsible for maintaining all mechanical systems — HVAC, plumbing, electrical, fire safety — in a 1,600+ room property running 24/7.

**Task:** The chief engineer needed someone to take ownership of the BAS interface and become the team's go-to person for automated system monitoring, while also maintaining strong working relationships with the senior engineers who had decades of experience with the building.

**Action:** Rather than coming in and trying to change established workflows, I focused on earning trust first. I volunteered for the toughest shifts, asked the senior engineers to walk me through the building's quirks and legacy systems, and positioned my BAS knowledge as a complement to — not a replacement for — their institutional knowledge. When I identified optimization opportunities through the BAS, I presented them as suggestions to the team rather than directives.

**Result:** Within 6 months, the senior engineers were proactively coming to me with BAS-related questions and requests. We improved response time to comfort complaints by 40% through proactive monitoring. I earned the trust of a tenured team, which is exactly the approach I'd take with Michael Ester and the controls team at AbbVie — respect the institutional knowledge and add value through my BAS fluency.

## STAR 5: "How do you handle working as a contractor and ramping up quickly?"

**Target Interviewer:** Matthew Connelly (Sterling) / John Walters (ramp-up)

**Situation:** Through Insight Global, I was placed at the Microsoft data center as an L4 Critical Environment Technician — a high-security, high-stakes contract environment.

**Task:** I needed to get badged, clear security protocols, learn Microsoft's proprietary procedures, and become operationally productive within my first two weeks — all while navigating a new CMMS platform (MCIM) and a large campus with multiple buildings.

**Action:** I created a personal 30-day ramp plan. Week 1: complete all safety training, get facility orientation, shadow every shift at least once. Week 2: begin independent rounds with check-ins, learn MCIM ticketing workflow. Week 3-4: take ownership of assigned zones, begin writing my own MOPs. I also identified the most experienced team members and built relationships early to accelerate my learning.

**Result:** I was fully independent by week 3 — ahead of the typical 4-6 week ramp. My manager noted it was one of the fastest contractor integrations on the team. I carried that same approach to CyrusOne. For this role, Sterling and AbbVie can expect the same rapid ramp-up — especially since I already know the Siemens platforms at the core of their operation.
