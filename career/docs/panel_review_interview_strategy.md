## Panel Assessment: Resume vs. Role Alignment

### 💼 Career Strategy Coach

> **Verdict: Strong alignment — your CyrusOne BAS experience is the headline.**
>
> Justice, your resume has a hidden gem that most candidates won't have: you were a **console operator on Siemens Apogee and Insight systems at CyrusOne** — the exact same platforms AbbVie runs. That's not theoretical knowledge; that's hands-on production experience. Lead with this.
>
> **Your positioning statement should be**:
> *"I've operated Siemens Apogee and Insight BAS in a mission-critical, 2.1-million-square-foot data center environment — managing 63 chillers, 48 AHUs, and 135 CRAHs across 18 data halls. I understand the stakes of controls engineering in facilities where downtime isn't an option."*
>
> That immediately sets you apart from candidates who've only studied these systems.

### 🏗️ Systems Architect

> **Verdict: Your breadth is your differentiator.**
>
> Looking at the team profiles:
>
> - Gino grew up internally from technician → developer — deep but narrow
> - Michael has 27 years in one seat — ultimate depth but limited cross-environment perspective
> - John is management — he evaluates, doesn't configure
>
> **You bring something none of them have**: experience across multiple BAS platforms (Siemens Apogee, Insight, Delta Controls EnteliWEB, TAC/IA Series) in multiple facility types (data center, hotel, pharmaceutical). That cross-pollination perspective is extremely valuable when they're evaluating Desigo migration strategies.

### 📋 Operations & Workflow Specialist

> **Verdict: Emphasize your structured operator discipline.**
>
> Your resume shows MOP/SOP/MSOW discipline from Microsoft, MCIM/Salesforce/Corrigo ticketing from CyrusOne, and Maximo CMMS context. In a pharmaceutical environment like AbbVie, **documentation and procedure compliance are everything** due to GxP regulations.
>
> **Key phrases to use**:
>
> - "Change management through MOPs"
> - "Documented standard operating procedures"
> - "Ticketing and work order discipline"
> - "Vendor coordination and escorting protocols"

### 🎯 Interview Performance Coach

> **Verdict: Watch the audience — tailor to who's asking.**
>
> Based on the LinkedIn profiles, here's how to read the room:
>
> | If speaking to... | Focus on... |
> |-------------------|-------------|
> | **John Walters** (Associate Director) | Project delivery, communication, documentation, team fit |
> | **Gino Pisano** (Controls Developer) | PPCL awareness, Siemens platform familiarity, BACnet protocols, troubleshooting approach |
> | **Michael Ester** (27-yr Controls Engineer) | Respect for institutional knowledge, reliability, willingness to learn legacy systems |
> | **Matthew Connelly** (Sterling Engineer) | Contracting experience, adaptability, ramp-up speed |
> | **Mary Gallian** (Recruiter) | Professional demeanor, enthusiasm, logistics |

## Top 5 Talking Points — In Priority Order

1. **Siemens BAS Console Operator Experience** — You ran Siemens Apogee and Insight live in production at CyrusOne. Not theoretical. Not classroom. Production.

2. **Critical Environment Pedigree** — Microsoft data center L4 technician. CyrusOne 2.1M sq ft campus. You understand what "no downtime" means.

3. **Formal Controls Education** — Pneumatic & Digital Controls coursework at Triton College/Local 399. HVAC program at ECC. You have the academic foundation *and* the field experience.

4. **Multi-Platform BAS Fluency** — Siemens Apogee, Siemens Insight, Delta Controls EnteliWEB, TAC/IA Enterprise Server. You can context-switch across platforms, which is critical during migrations.

5. **Documentation & Compliance Discipline** — MOP/SOP methodology, ticketing systems (Corrigo, MCIM, Zendesk), vendor management. Ready for the GxP pharmaceutical compliance environment.

## Gaps to Address Proactively

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The panel identified these areas where you should get ahead of potential questions:

| Potential Question | Recommended Response |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| *"Have you written PPCL code?"* | "I've operated systems running PPCL logic and understand the sequence of operations. I've studied PPCL syntax and patterns and I'm eager to go deeper — I see Gino is actively developing in PPCL and I'd welcome the chance to learn from someone with that hands-on experience." |
| *"Do you have Desigo CC experience?"* | "Not directly, but I understand it's the modern successor to Insight/Apogee, and I see the team is actively transitioning. My experience with multiple BAS platforms means I pick up new systems quickly — I went from zero to console operator on Delta Controls EnteliWEB in my first months at CyrusOne." |
| *"Why leave Microsoft/data centers for pharma?"* | "Building automation in pharma is a higher-stakes, more nuanced challenge — you're not just managing temperature for equipment, you're maintaining environments that affect drug safety and human health. That responsibility-level appeals to me." |
