## Your Positioning

### Factors That Push Your Rate Higher

- ✅ Siemens Apogee & Insight **production experience** (not just training)
- ✅ Critical environment background (Microsoft data center L4)
- ✅ Multi-platform BAS fluency (Siemens, Delta Controls, TAC/IA)
- ✅ Stationary Engineer License (City of Chicago)
- ✅ OSHA 30, NFPA 70E, EPA 608 certifications
- ✅ Formal controls education (Triton College, ECC)

### Factors to Consider

- ⚠️ This is a **contract role** through Sterling — contract rates are sometimes higher hourly but without benefits
- ⚠️ PPCL coding is a **growth area** for you, not a current deep skill
- ⚠️ No direct pharma/cGMP experience yet (but your MOP/SOP discipline translates)

### Recommended Range

> [!TIP]
> **Don't discuss specific numbers in the interview** — Sterling's guide explicitly says to stay consistent with what you discussed with Mary. If pressed, defer to the recruiter.

If Mary asks you to confirm expectations:

| Scenario | Rate |
|----------|------|
| **Contract (W-2 through Sterling)** | $48 – $58/hr |
| **Contract (if negotiating)** | $55 – $65/hr (cite Siemens platform experience + critical env pedigree) |
| **Full-time equivalent** | $105K – $125K |

*Adjust based on what Mary discussed in the screening call. Do NOT volunteer numbers first — let them make the first offer.*
