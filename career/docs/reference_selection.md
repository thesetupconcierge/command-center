# Reference Selection — AbbVie / Sterling Engineering

> Best references to provide for a Building Automation Controls Engineer role

## Recommended Order (Most → Least Relevant)

### 1. ✅ William Carter — Lead CE Technician, Insight Global → Microsoft
>
> *+1 (773) 815-6571 · <willcarter@microsoft.com>*

**Why lead with William**: He was your Lead CE Technician — he can speak directly to your technical capabilities in a critical environment, your reliability under pressure, and your growth as an engineer. His current Microsoft role validates the quality of the team you were part of.

### 2. ✅ Simon Sopt — Senior Critical Environment Technician, Microsoft
>
> *+1 (219) 741-9092 · <ssopt@microsoft.com>*

**Why**: Senior peer who can vouch for your hands-on technical work, troubleshooting approach, and ability to maintain uptime in a mission-critical environment. His seniority adds weight.

### 3. ✅ Ike Riley Jr. — Shift Manager, Microsoft
>
> *+1 (708) 981-6077 · <iker@warriorsneverquit.com>*

**Why**: Management-level reference who can speak to your professionalism, shift reliability, team collaboration, and work ethic. A manager reference is important for any role — John Walters (hiring manager) will want to hear how you work within a team.

### 4. ⚡ Welmon Sampson — District Critical Environment Operations Manager, Microsoft
>
> *Email only: <wsampson@microsoft.com>*

**Why hold in reserve**: This is a **district-level manager** — a very strong reference if needed, but email-only contact method makes him harder to reach quickly. Use as a power reference if they request a 4th or if the process gets competitive.

## References to Avoid for This Role

| Reference | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Andrew York (Colleague, ECC/Local 399) | Peer/classmate — less weight than supervisory references |
| Isaiah Tejada (Colleague, Local 399) | Same — peer level, better saved for union-related roles |
| John O'Connor (Business Agent, Local 399) | Union business agent — relevant for union roles but may not resonate in a corporate pharma/staffing context |

These are still **valid references** — just not the strongest picks for *this specific role*. Keep them for future opportunities where union affiliation or trade school connections matter.
