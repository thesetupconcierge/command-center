Dear John,

Thank you for taking the time to meet with me today to discuss the Building Automation Controls Engineer position at AbbVie. It was truly a pleasure speaking with you and the team — I appreciated the open conversation and the opportunity to learn more about the facility, the controls infrastructure, and the work you're all doing on campus.

From our conversation, I understand the team needs a controls engineer who can operate and maintain the Siemens BAS infrastructure — Apogee Insight and Desigo CC — across a regulated pharmaceutical campus, support HVAC and utility system troubleshooting, contribute to PPCL programming and BACnet controller work, and maintain the documentation and change control discipline that a cGMP environment demands.

I believe my background positions me well to contribute from day one. As a BAS console operator at CyrusOne, I managed Siemens Apogee and Insight systems across a 2.1-million-square-foot data center campus — monitoring 63 chillers, 48 AHUs, and 135 CRAHs across 18 data halls in a zero-downtime environment. That hands-on, production-level experience with the same Siemens platforms your team relies on, combined with my MOP and documentation discipline from Microsoft and my formal Pneumatic & Digital Controls education through Local 399, gives me a strong foundation to support both the day-to-day operations and the longer-term projects the team is tackling. I'm also eager to deepen my PPCL programming skills and learn from the depth of expertise your controls team brings — the opportunity to grow in a pharmaceutical environment where the work directly impacts drug safety and patient outcomes is exactly the kind of challenge I'm looking for.

I am very excited about this opportunity and the chance to join the team at AbbVie. I'm available to start as soon as needed and would welcome hearing about the next steps in the process.

Thank you again for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Justice McKinney
