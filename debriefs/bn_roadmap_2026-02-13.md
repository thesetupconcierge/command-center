# Black Nexus Roadmap — 2026-02-13

> [!TIP]
> **New to the workflow?** Read the **[Ops Onboarding Guide](bn_ops_onboarding.md)** first to understand how we track action items and manage context.

## 🎯 Primary Objective: System Mirroring

Following the Setup Concierge standard, JB's first major technical milestone is to build a **Black Nexus Command Center** that mirrors the operational structure used by Justice.

### 🏗️ Architecture: The Dashboard Pattern

The "actual command center" used by Justice (see `Setup Concierge/Dashboard/index.html` for reference) follows a specific pattern you should replicate:

1. **Single-Page HTML**: Vanilla JS/CSS for zero-dependency portability.
2. **TASK_DATA Object**: A JSON-like structure that holds all milestones and tasks.
3. **Scorecard SVG**: Dynamic rings that track completion % by area (WNQ, SC, BN).
4. **Captain’s Log**: A simple localStorage-backed feed for documenting wins/decisions.
