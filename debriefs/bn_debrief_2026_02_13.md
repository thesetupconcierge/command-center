## 🏗️ Project: WNQ Premium Website (Path A)

The WNQ build has shifted from a 6-page to an **8-page premium showcase** to better capture the client's emotional core and legacy.

### Status Update

- **Built**: `index.html` (Home) — fully responsive with premium foundations.
- **In Pipeline**:
  - **Coach Tribute (Legacy)**: Museum-style memorial, timeline-driven design.
  - **Scholarship**: Linked from tribute, focused on eligibility and giving.
  - **About**: Board member profiles using ready-to-go image cutouts.
- **Blocked**: Waiting for historical family photos from WNQ for the Tribute page.

### Critical Decisions

- **Build Priority**: Front-loading the **Coach Tribute** as it justifies the $3,000 custom value.
- **Design Tone**: Dark, reverent aesthetic for Legacy pages vs. energetic Purple/Blue for the main site.

## 🏛️ Advisory Panel Findings (Feb 12)

- **👔 Darius Cole (Ops)**: Directs reordering of build to prioritize emotional impact pages.
- **🧭 Mira Voss (Workflow)**: Found drift between Brand Kit (Purple) and Staging Site (Royal Blue). **Justice to confirm primary palette.**
- **🛡️ RayRay Navarro (QA/Compactor)**: Identified 1.5GB image overhead; enforcing WebP conversion and selective asset usage to prevent system hangups.
